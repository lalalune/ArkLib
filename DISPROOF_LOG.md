## wf-NC — Gross-Koblitz / p-adic Γ_p refinement of Stickelberger (UNIT part) — PINNED (2026-06-14)

Lens: GK expresses g(χ^{−a}) = −π^a·Γ_p(⟨a/(p−1)⟩) (q=p prime ⇒ residue degree f=1);
η_b = (1/m)Σ_k ζ_{p−1}^{−nkc} g(χ^{nk}) is a ζ-weighted sum of GK factors. Hoped: dyadic
base-p digit-sum of a=nk + Γ_p reflection/multiplication ⇒ sub-trivial archimedean max_b|η_b|.
All numerics exact-as-float ~1e-14, n=8,16,32, multiple p≡1 (mod n).

- NC1 (f=1 single Γ_p factor): for q prime the GK product runs over the Frobenius orbit of size
  f=1 → ONE Γ_p factor per Gauss sum. No multi-factor product ⇒ the dyadic digit-sum handle is
  STRUCTURALLY ABSENT. The genuine multi-Γ_p / digit-sum lever needs f≥2 (q a prime power), which
  the prize forbids. (probe_wf2NC_gammap_valuation.py)
- NC2 (unit part has no archimedean SUP content): GK pins v_p(g)=a/(p−1) (=Stickelberger=section-6
  magnitude) and the unit Γ_p as a p-adic unit (|Γ_p|_p=1); |g|=√p is archimedean, independent of
  the unit congruence. Adversarial test (4000 trials): SUP achievable under the Γ_p reflection
  U(nk)U(−nk)=+1 EQUALS the SUP under |U|=1 alone (~0.86–0.95·√(p−n)); true SUP (0.58–0.79·√(p−n))
  sits strictly below, i.e. the genuine cancellation is NOT a GK relation. (probe_wf2NC_sup_vs_gk.py,
  probe_wf2NC_gk_phase.py)
- NC3 (no product→sum bridge): Davenport-Hasse/Stickelberger pin Π_k g(χ^{nk}) (= the norm/house,
  section-6 magnitude object), verified exact (rel.err ~1e-14); the SUP needs max_c|Σ_k ...|. A single
  product equation among m−1 unit phases does not bound a max-of-sum. (probe_wf2NC_gammap_valuation.py)

Why NEW (vs section-6 Stickelberger MAGNITUDE no-go): this is the complementary fact — the GK
unit/Γ_p part (the thing section-6 excludes) carries NO archimedean SUP info at f=1, and the only
digit-sum handle lives at f≥2 off the prize. The reflection formula reduces to the already-refuted
antipodal char-0 symmetry (T09-leak). Wall: GK adds nothing to max_b|η_b| for q prime.
