# The transparent commitment scheme

The **transparent** (a.k.a. *trivial* or *identity*) commitment scheme is the degenerate functional
commitment in which the commitment to a piece of data is the data itself. There is no hiding, no key
material, and the opening protocol is the verifier locally re-evaluating the oracle on the committed
data and checking it against the claimed response.

It is the baseline commitment used by *transparent* IOP-to-IP compilers: when the verifier is
allowed to read the prover's messages in the clear, "committing" is the identity map and "opening"
is a local check. Even though it is hiding-free, it is a genuine functional commitment scheme and is
the natural concrete instance to feed to the BCS compiler interface (`ArkLib.OracleReduction.BCS`)
when one wants an end-to-end compiled protocol without an algebraic commitment.

This file provides:

* `transparentScheme`, the concrete `Commitment.Scheme` with `Commitment = Data`,
  `Decommitment = ComKey = VerifKey = Unit`, and a one-message opening whose verifier checks
  `OracleInterface.answer cm q = y`.
* `transparentScheme_perfectCorrectness`: the scheme is perfectly correct — the honest opening is
  always accepted (error `0`).
* `verdict_accept_imp`: the mathematical core of (perfect) evaluation binding — any accepting opening
  verdict on `(cm, q, r)` forces `OracleInterface.answer cm q = r`. Two accepting openings for
  `r₁ ≠ r₂` would therefore force `r₁ = answer cm q = r₂`, a contradiction, so the scheme is
  perfectly evaluation-binding.

The correctness proof follows the structure of `ArkLib.CommitmentScheme.KZG.Correctness`.

/-- The transparent commitment scheme over data type `Data` with oracle interface `O`.

* `keygen` and `commit` are trivial: there are no keys and the commitment to `data` is `data`.
* The opening is a one-message proof: the (honest) prover claims acceptance, and the verifier checks
  the claimed response `y` against the committed data by re-evaluating `OracleInterface.answer`.

/-- **Determinism of the transparent opening verdict.** Because the opening verifier ignores the
prover's transcript and simply re-evaluates the oracle, the verdict of any opening run on
`(cm, q, r)` — honest or malicious prover — is either failure (`none`) or the single boolean
`decide (answer cm q = r)`. In particular an accepting verdict forces `answer cm q = r`; this is the
mathematical content of perfect evaluation binding for the transparent scheme. -/
