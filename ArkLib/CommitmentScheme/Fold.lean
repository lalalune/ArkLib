# Folding-based Polynomial Commitment Schemes

This module is the commitment-scheme namespace for IOP-based polynomial folding frameworks such
as FRI, Circle-FRI, Binius, and BaseFold. ArkLib currently develops the concrete protocol objects
and proofs for those systems under `ProofSystem`; this file intentionally stays as the
commitment-layer import surface until a shared folding-commitment API is factored out of those
protocol-specific developments.
