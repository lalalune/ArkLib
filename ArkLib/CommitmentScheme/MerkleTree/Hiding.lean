# Hiding for inductive Merkle-tree commitments (salted leaves)

A plain Merkle commitment is *not* hiding: the root and an opening can leak information about the
committed leaf (e.g. a low-entropy leaf can be brute-forced through the public hash). The standard
fix (SNARGs book §18) is to commit to *salted* leaves: each leaf `v` is replaced by a leaf
commitment `leafCommit r v` using fresh randomness (salt) `r`, and the Merkle tree is built over the
salted leaves. Opening reveals `(v, r)` together with the authentication path.

This file provides:

* `leafCommit` / `saltedLeaves` / `buildSaltedTree` — the salted-leaf commitment construction over
  the VCVio inductive Merkle tree.
* `salted_completeness` — a **fully proven** correctness lemma: the salted construction is itself an
  honest Merkle tree over the commitment leaves, so single-index completeness transports verbatim.
* `simulatorTranscript` — the simulator-facing transcript generator that keeps opened leaves and
  replaces unopened leaves by a fixed filler before sampling salts and building the transcript.
* `SimulationBasedHiding` / `simulationBasedHiding_implies_Hiding` — the hybrid proof skeleton:
  if every real transcript distribution is equal to its simulator distribution, then the existing
  `Hiding` predicate follows.

## What remains probabilistic

The simulator/hybrid layer below proves the exact logical discharge of `Hiding` from a real-to-ideal
transcript equality. In the random-oracle model, that premise is the usual salting/programming
argument: unopened salted leaves are replaced by fresh random digest values, with loss bounded by
salt/query collisions. ArkLib now exposes the right theorem boundary instead of leaving the
`Hiding` predicate disconnected from simulators.

/-- **Hiding (indistinguishability definition, SNARGs book §18).** A salted Merkle commitment is
hiding for a fixed opened index set `idxs` if, for *any* two leaf assignments `leaves₁`, `leaves₂`
that agree on the opened positions, the published transcripts are computationally indistinguishable
when the salts are drawn from the salt sampler `sampleSalts`. We phrase indistinguishability as
equality of the induced output distributions of the transcript over the random choice of salts —
the perfect-hiding specialization; a computational version would replace `=` by an
indistinguishability relation.

This is a *definition only*; see the module roadmap for why a proof is out of scope here. -/
