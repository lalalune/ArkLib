# Fairness of dynamic concurrent runs

This file adds the first fairness layer on top of `Concurrent.ProcessOver.Run`.

The key design choice is that fairness is phrased in terms of stable
`Tickets`, not raw frontier events. This matters because the concrete event
type available at one residual process state need not even be comparable with
the event type at a later state, while a ticket is meant to name the same
scheduling obligation across time and across different presentations of the
same protocol.

The closed-world `Process` API is recovered as a specialization of these
generic definitions.
