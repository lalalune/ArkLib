# Common concurrent equivalence notions

This file packages the bisimulation-based equivalence notions that are most
useful in practice.

The underlying `Refinement.Bisimulation` API is intentionally general: it can
talk about any step relation whatsoever. For actual protocol work, however, one
usually wants a smaller family of standard questions:

* do the two systems expose the same controller at each step?
* do they expose the same full controller path?
* do they produce the same external event trace?
* do they preserve the same fairness tickets?
* does a chosen party observe the same thing in both systems?

This file packages exactly those questions as named equivalence notions and
records the immediate preservation lemmas for finite run prefixes.
