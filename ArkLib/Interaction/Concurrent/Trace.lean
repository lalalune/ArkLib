# Finite concurrent traces

This file defines finite traces of concurrent interaction specs.

For sequential `Interaction.Spec`, a `Transcript` records one complete root-to-
leaf play through a tree whose next move family is always unique.

For concurrent `Interaction.Concurrent.Spec`, there may be multiple currently
enabled frontier events at once. A `Trace S` therefore records one **finite
scheduler linearization**:

* choose one frontier event of `S`;
* continue with the residual spec after that event;
* repeat until reaching a quiescent residual with no enabled frontier events.

So `Trace` is the finite interleaving-level execution object associated to the
concurrent core. If a later true-concurrency layer adds independence or partial-
order semantics, those refinements should be layered over these linear traces
rather than replacing the basic execution story here.

`Trace S` is a finite execution trace of the concurrent spec `S`.

It records one scheduler-chosen linearization of frontier events, ending when
the residual concurrent spec becomes quiescent, meaning its frontier type is
empty.

This should be read as the concurrent analogue of a sequential transcript, but
with one crucial difference:
the constructors record **frontier choices** rather than the moves of a
single always-current node.
