# STIR proximity gap for Reed-Solomon codes

This file states the proximity-gap theorem for Reed-Solomon codes used by STIR (Theorem 4.1),
relating the probability that a random linear combination of words is close to the code to the
existence of a common large agreement set for the individual words.

/-- Theorem 4.1[BCIKS20] from [ACFY24stir]
  Let `C = RS[F, ι, degree]` be a ReedSolomon code with rate `degree / |ι|`
  and let Bstar(ρ) = √ρ. For all `δ ∈ (0, 1 - Bstar(ρ))`, `f₁,...,fₘ : ι → F`, if
  `Pr_{r ← F} [ δᵣ(rⱼ * fⱼ, C) ≤ δ] > err'(degree, ρ, δ, m)`
  then ∃ S ⊆ ι, |S| ≥ (1 - δ) * |ι| and
  ∀ i : m, ∃ u : C, u(S) = fᵢ(S)

  STATUS (audit 2026-06-04, branch arklib-sorry-fixes). Open proof. Two independent,
  machine-checked blockers — this is a documented statement-vs-source mismatch, not a closure:

  1. STATEMENT DEFECT (free `GenFun`). As written, `GenFun : F → Fin m → F` is universally
     quantified with no constraint, so the statement is FALSE: instantiate `GenFun r j = 0`,
     then the combination `∑ⱼ GenFun r j * f j x ≡ 0 ∈ C`, so the hypothesis `Pr[… ≤ δ] = 1 >
     err'` holds for every `f`, yet arbitrary `fᵢ` need not agree with any codeword on a large
     set. The intended instance is the monomial / Vandermonde generator `GenFun r j = r^j`
     (cf. `RSGenerator.genRSC`, ProofSystem/Whir/ProximityGen.lean: `Gen = {r ↦ (j ↦ r^(exp j))}`,
     and `Generator.ProximityGenerator.proximity`, which is this exact statement specialised to
     that generator — itself still open). A faithful repair fixes `GenFun r j = r^j` (or adds
     a `ProximityGenerator`-style hypothesis on `GenFun`). This file has no consumers
     (`grep STIR.proximity_gap` ⇒ only its own definition), so the statement is currently inert.

  2. SOURCE open proof (Johnson/√ρ regime). Even the monomial instance reduces to BCIKS20 Thm 1.5,
     `ProximityGap.correlatedAgreement_affine_curves` (Data/.../BCIKS20/Curves.lean), via
     `proximityError F degree ρ δ m = (m-1) * errorBound δ degree domain` and the degree-`(m-1)`
     curve `∑ᵢ rⁱ • fᵢ`. But `correlatedAgreement_affine_curves` is a flat `sorry`, and the whole
     BCIKS20 CA tree (lines → spaces → curves) is proven ONLY in the unique-decoding regime
     `δ ≤ relUDR`: the affine-lines base `RS_correlatedAgreement_affineLines`
     (Data/.../BCIKS20/AffineLines/Main.lean:40) is open in the list-decoding regime
     `relUDR < δ < 1 - √ρ`. `#print axioms` confirms `correlatedAgreement_affine_spaces`,
     `correlatedAgreement_affine_curves`, `proximity_gap_RSCodes` and `Combine.combine_theorem`
     all carry `sorryAx`; only `RS_correlatedAgreement_affineLines_uniqueDecodingRegime` is clean
     (axioms ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}). The √ρ-radius hypothesis here
     (`δ < 1 - Bstar ρ`, with `Bstar ρ = √ρ = sqrtRate`) hits exactly the unproven LDR branch.

  Honest residual: close `AffineLines/Main.lean:40` (Thm 5.1, list-decoding regime), which
  lifts `correlatedAgreement_affine_curves`; then `proximity_gap` (monomial form) follows from
  the curves CA. No clean intermediate path exists today. -/
