# Structured (Witness-Mode) Sumcheck — Types and Helpers

This file collects the data types and degree-bookkeeping helpers used by the
**structured sumcheck**: the witness-mode degree-2 multilinear-times-multilinear sumcheck
that underlies Binius BinaryBasefold, Binius RingSwitching, and (in the future) Hachi.

Unlike the canonical, oracle-mode sumcheck in `ArkLib/ProofSystem/Sumcheck/Spec/*`, where
the polynomial being sumchecked is an oracle statement accessible to the verifier, here
the polynomial `H = m · t` is the prover's *witness*: `t` is a committed multilinear, `m`
is a context-dependent multilinear multiplier, and `H` is their degree-2 product. The
verifier sees only the prover's round polynomials `pᵢ`, not `H` directly.

The two modes coexist as parallel primitives under `Sumcheck`. See
`GENERIC_RING_SWITCHING_PLAN.md` §1.5 for the design discussion.

## TODO (option C, tracked separately)

After the structured-sumcheck protocol code lands (PR 2 of the same plan), an issue should
be opened to prove the structured-mode soundness is derivable from the canonical-mode
soundness via the refinement `H = m · t`. Until then, the two modes carry independent
proofs.

## Contents (lifted verbatim from `Binius.BinaryBasefold.Basic` § `SumcheckOperations`)

- `MultilinearPoly`, `MultiquadraticPoly` — degree-1 / degree-2 `MvPolynomial` abbreviations.
- `SumcheckMultiplierParam` — bundles a `Context → MultilinearPoly` (the multiplier `m`).
- `computeInitialSumcheckPoly` — `H := m · t` with the degree-2 proof.
- `projectToMidSumcheckPoly`, `projectToNextSumcheckPoly` — partial evaluation of `H` at
  the verifier's previous challenges.
- `SumcheckBaseContext` — `(t_eval_point, original_claim)` shared input.
- `Statement Context i` — per-round state: `(sumcheck_target, challenges, ctx)`.
- `sumcheckConsistencyProp` — claim equals hypercube sum.

section Witness

/-- Witness for the structured sumcheck at round `i`:

- `H`  — the projected round polynomial `H_i(X_i, …, X_{ℓ-1})`, equal to the multiquadratic
  product `m · t'` with the first `i` variables fixed to the verifier's previous challenges.

Lifted from `Binius.RingSwitching.SumcheckWitness`. Generic in shape; PR 2b's per-round
prover/verifier consume this witness uniformly across all structured-sumcheck instantiations. -/
