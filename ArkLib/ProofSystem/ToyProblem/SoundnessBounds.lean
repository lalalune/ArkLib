# Toy problem soundness bounds (ABF26 §6)

Statement-layer for the §6 soundness bounds that do **not** depend on a
formal protocol object. The three protocol-level soundness lemmas
(`L6.6`, `L6.8`, `L6.10`) live alongside the protocol definitions in
`ToyProblem/Spec/General.lean` (C6.2) and
`ToyProblem/Spec/SimplifiedIOR.lean` (C6.9).

Items in this file:

* `ToyProblem.additive_code_supports_erasure_correction_grs25`
   — Lemma 6.5 [GRS25]: every additive code supports erasure correction
   with correction time `O((s · n)^3)`.

* `ToyProblem.simplified_iop_soundness_listDecoding_lb`
   — Lemma 6.12 [ABF26]: list-decoding-based lower bound on the
   soundness error of the simplified IOR `T'[C, t]` (Construction 6.9).
   Uses Claim B.1 via `Probability.exists_large_image_of_pairwise_collision_bound`.

* `ToyProblem.simplified_iop_soundness_ca_lb`
   — Lemma 6.13 [ABF26]: correlated-agreement-based lower bound on the
   soundness error of `T'[C, t]`.

Current status:

* **L6.5** is `external admit [GRS25]` — a classical result imported from
  another work; PROVEN here in existence form (the polynomial-time content
  is the inert numeric parameter; the unique close-codeword decoder is
  unconditional).
* **L6.13 is PROVEN** (`simplified_iop_soundness_ca_lb`), under a documented
  statement repair: the `F`-linear encoder hypothesis `hEnc` on `C` (exactly
  the regime `relation`/`relaxedRelation` already demand). See its docstring.
* **L6.12 is partially closed** — its three prerequisite lemmas (finite-iSup
  attainment, the §6.4.1 Step-2 collision bound `linearForm_collision_prob`,
  and Claim B.1 `exists_large_image_of_pairwise_collision_bound`) are all
  proven; the residual sorry is the §6.4.1 Step-4 winning-set construction
  (list-of-pairs image → single-instance winning challenges), which is the
  genuine protocol-attack combinatorics. See its docstring.

L6.12/L6.13 are stated in coding-theory form (direct cardinality bounds on
`winningSet`); their protocol-level reading bounds the soundness of
`ToyProblem.SimplifiedIOR.reduction` from below.

/-- **Linear-functional collision bound** (ABF26 §6.4.1, Step 2 kernel count).

For a nonzero coefficient vector `w : Fin k → F` over a finite field, the
linear functional `v ↦ ∑ j, w j * v j : (Fin k → F) → F` is surjective, so
each of its fibers has cardinality `|F|^k / |F| = |F|^{k-1}`. Hence a
uniformly random `v` lands in the zero-fiber (the kernel hyperplane) with
probability exactly `1 / |F|`. This is the per-pair collision bound fed to
Claim B.1 in the proof of `simplified_iop_soundness_listDecoding_lb`. -/

/-- **Lemma 6.5 of [ABF26]** (= [GRS25]).

Every `F`-additive code `C : F^k → (F^s)^n` supports erasure correction
(in the sense of `CodingTheory.SupportsErasureCorrection`) with correction
time `O((s · n)^3)`. Equivalently: the predicate
`CodingTheory.SupportsErasureCorrection C ecor` holds for some
`ecor ≤ K · (s · n)^3`. We state the more permissive
"some `ecor` works" form here; pinning down the constant `K` requires
modelling the encoder concretely.

PROVEN (existence form). The paper's L6.5 / [GRS25] content is the
*polynomial running time* `O((s·n)^3)`; the `SupportsErasureCorrection`
predicate carries `ecor` as an inert numeric parameter (`_ecor`), so the
*existence* of a correct (not necessarily efficient) erasure-decoder is an
unconditional, in-tree fact: when fewer than `minDist C` symbols are erased
the agreeing codeword is unique (two such codewords would differ only on
the erased coordinates, giving Hamming distance `< minDist C`, forcing
equality), so a classical decoder choosing that witness is well-defined.
We take `ecor = 0` (the numeric time bound is not operationally modelled). -/

/-- **Lemma 6.12 of [ABF26]** (list-decoding lower bound on the simplified IOR).

Coding-theory form: if `|F| > binomial(|Λ(C^{≡2}, δ)|, 2)`, then there
exist witnesses `(v, μ_1, μ_2, f_1, f_2)` with `(f_1, f_2)` lying outside
the relaxed relation `R̃_{C,δ}^2`, for which the winning challenge set
`Ω^{f_1,f_2}_{v,μ_1,μ_2}` (Definition 6.11) has at least
`|Λ(C^{≡2}, δ)| · |F| / (|F| + |Λ(C^{≡2}, δ)| - 1)` elements.

The protocol-level reading: the soundness error of the simplified IOR
`T'[C, t]` (Construction 6.9, `ToyProblem.SimplifiedIOR.reduction`) is
at least `|Λ(C^{≡2}, δ)| / (|F| + |Λ(C^{≡2}, δ)| - 1)`.

## Proof recipe (ABF26 §6.4.1, with B.1 now machine-checked)

The bound `N · F / (F + N − 1)` (writing `N := |Λ(C^{≡2}, δ)|`,
`F := |F|`) is exactly the conclusion of Claim B.1 specialised to
`|S| = N`, `|T| = F`, `ε = 1/F`:
```
N / (1 + (N − 1) · (1/F)) = N · F / (F + N − 1)
```
so the proof skeleton is:

1. **Build the list.** Enumerate `Λ(C^{≡2}, δ)` as `λ : Fin N → ι → F × ι → F`,
   pairs `(W₀(λ), W₁(λ))` of `δ`-close codewords in `C` (paper writes
   `(v_0(λ), v_1(λ))`). Pick any `v ∈ F^k` and define the "evaluation"
   function `φ_v : Fin N → F × F` by `λ ↦ (⟨W₀(λ), v⟩, ⟨W₁(λ), v⟩) — μ`-pair shape.

2. **Pairwise collision bound.** For `λ ≠ λ'` with `(W₀(λ), W₁(λ)) ≠
   (W₀(λ'), W₁(λ'))`, the linear functional `⟨·, v⟩` collides on the
   distinct difference vector with probability `1/F` over a uniform
   `v ←$ F^k`. This is the in-tree predicate
   `Pr_{ let v ←$ᵖ (Fin k → F) }[(decide (φ_v λ = φ_v λ') : Prop)] ≤ 1/F`.
   Unfold via [`ProbabilityTheory.Pr_decide_eq_tsum_indicator`] from
   [`Probability/Notation.lean`](../../Data/Probability/Notation.lean).

3. **Apply B.1.** Feed steps 1 + 2 into
   [`Probability.exists_large_image_of_pairwise_collision_bound`]
   (`ArkLib/Data/Probability/Combinatorial.lean`) to obtain a
   `v* ∈ F^k` whose induced `φ_{v*}` has image size at least
   `N · F / (F + N − 1)` in `F × F`.

4. **Convert to winning set.** Each distinct `(μ₁, μ₂) ∈ image φ_{v*}`
   corresponds to a `γ ∈ winningSet` via the list-decoding bijection
   (paper §6.4.1 — `μ_i = ⟨W_i(λ), v*⟩` for some `λ`, and the constraint
   `μ_new = μ₁ + γ · μ₂` admits a unique `γ` per such pair under the
   `|F| > binom(N, 2)` regime). The witness `(v*, μ₁, μ₂, f₁ := W₀,
   f₂ := W₁)` for some chosen `λ₀ ∈ Λ` exits the proof.

## Status (2026-06): steps 1–3 helpers now in tree; step 4 is the residual

Of the four steps, three now have machine-checked support and only the
step-4 winning-set construction remains:

  * **Step 1 (iSup maximizer extraction) — helper PROVEN.** `Lambda C δ =
    ⨆ f, (close…).ncard` is `ℕ∞`-valued over the finite type `f : ι → F`;
    the generic attainment lemma `finite_iSup_eq_apply` (above) extracts the
    maximiser. The residual `ℕ∞`/`.toNat` bookkeeping (the `Lambda = ⊤`
    branch makes `.toNat = 0`, trivialising the bound) and the `Fin N`
    indexing via `Set.Finite.toFinset` are routine on top of it.

  * **Step 2 (collision probability) — PROVEN** as `linearForm_collision_prob`
    (above): for nonzero `w`, `Pr_{v ←$ F^k}[∑ j, w j v j = 0] = 1/|F|`, via
    surjective-additive-hom fiber equinumerosity. For a distinct codeword
    pair, at least one of the two difference vectors `W₀(λ)−W₀(λ')`,
    `W₁(λ)−W₁(λ')` is nonzero, so the joint-collision probability is bounded
    by this single-functional `1/|F|`.

  * **Step 3 (Claim B.1) — PROVEN** as
    `Probability.exists_large_image_of_pairwise_collision_bound`.

  * **Step 4 (winning-set construction) — RESIDUAL.** Even with the
    linear-encoder hypothesis (cf. `simplified_iop_soundness_ca_lb`, which
    closes the analogous `relation`-from-membership wall via `hEnc`), the
    L6.12 conclusion bounds a *single* `winningSet C δ v* μ₁ μ₂ f₁ f₂` over
    challenges `γ ∈ F`, whereas B.1 produces a large *image set* of pairs
    `(μ₁(λ), μ₂(λ)) ∈ F × F` indexed by the codeword list. Bridging the two
    is the genuine §6.4.1 attack combinatorics: from the list one must build
    a concrete attack instance and an injection from image pairs into winning
    challenges (`μ_new = μ₁ + γ·μ₂` solved for a unique `γ` per pair under
    `|F| > binom(N, 2)`). This is a multi-step protocol-attack development,
    not a mechanical application of B.1, and is left for follow-up.

## Faithfulness note (2026-06): why a trivial witness is INADMISSIBLE here

The Lean conclusion is an *existential* over `(v, μ₁, μ₂, f₁, f₂)` and — unlike
the paper's prose — does **not** carry the §6.4 side condition that `(f₁, f₂)`
violate the relaxed relation `R̃²_{C,δ}`. The arithmetic bound is weak:
`N·|F| / (|F| + N − 1) ≤ |F|` for all `N ≥ 0` (since `N ≤ |F| + N − 1` whenever
`|F| ≥ 1`). Hence the all-zero instance `v = 0, μ₁ = μ₂ = 0, f₁ = f₂ = 0`
*formally* discharges the goal: under `hEnc` the zero word lies in `C` and
satisfies `relation C 0 0 0` (via the `hrel_of_mem` bridge proved in
`simplified_iop_soundness_ca_lb`), so `winningSet C δ 0 0 0 0 0 = F` and its
`ncard = |F| ≥ N·|F|/(|F|+N−1)`. **This trivial proof is deliberately NOT
submitted**: it is vacuous (the all-zero `(f₁,f₂)` is *inside* `R̃²`, the exact
instance the paper excludes), it bypasses Steps 1–3 entirely, and it
misrepresents L6.12's content (the bound is only meaningful as a *lower bound
on the soundness error realised by a violating attack instance*). A faithful
proof must (a) add the §6.4 violation hypothesis `¬ R̃²_{C,δ}(f₁,f₂)` to the
statement — which blocks the all-zero witness — and (b) realise the genuine
Step-4 maximiser+injection attack. Both are deferred together; the residual
below is that faithful proof, not the vacuous discharge.

Tagged sorry (`paper-proof-owed`, step 4 only) — ABF26's OWN result
(§6.4.1). Steps 1–3 are realised by in-tree lemmas; the residual is the
list→challenge winning-set injection, which additionally needs the
`hEnc` linear-encoder hypothesis (as in `simplified_iop_soundness_ca_lb`)
and the §6.4 violation hypothesis (see the faithfulness note above).

## Integrated Step-2/Step-4 helpers (PROVEN, axiom-clean)

The following sorry-free, axiom-clean helpers (immediately above) are the
genuine partial progress toward this residual; the main `sorry` is *not*
discharged, but these are reusable by whoever completes Step 4:

  * `listDecoding_lb_le_card` : `N·|F| / (|F| + N − 1) ≤ |F|` (the loose-bound
    clamp / faithfulness-note arithmetic core).
  * `one_le_listDecoding_lb` : `1 ≤ N·|F| / (|F| + N − 1)` for `N, |F| ≥ 1`
    (a faithful attack must exhibit ≥ 1 winning challenge).
  * `listDecoding_lb_zero_of_card_zero` : `N = 0 ⇒ N·|F| / (|F| + N − 1) ≤ 0`
    (honest empty-list branch — vacuous *bound*, never a vacuous *witness*).
  * `pair_linearForm_collision_le` : the Step-2 *pair*-collision bound feeding
    Claim B.1 — distinct message pairs collide under `v ↦ (⟨m₀,v⟩,⟨m₁,v⟩)`
    with probability `≤ 1/|F|`, via the proven `linearForm_collision_prob`. -/

/-- **Lemma 6.13 of [ABF26]** (correlated-agreement lower bound on the simplified IOR).

Coding-theory form: there exist `(v, μ_1, μ_2, f_1, f_2)` with
`(f_1, f_2)` outside the relaxed relation `R̃_{C,δ}^2` whose winning
challenge set has size at least `ε_ca(C, δ) · |F|`.

Protocol-level reading: the soundness error of the simplified IOR
`T'[C, t]` (Construction 6.9) is at least `ε_ca(C, δ)`.

Proof sketch: take `f_1, f_2` maximising the CA error; then
`f_1 + γ·f_2` is `δ`-close to `C` precisely on a set `S` of size
`ε_ca · |F|`, and `S` is contained in the winning set
`Ω^{f_1,f_2}_{0^k, 0, 0}` of Definition 6.11.

## Documented statement repair (2026-06): linear-encoder hypothesis on `C`

The prior audit identified a *statement-level* wall, not mere proof effort.
`epsCA C δ δ = ⨆ u : WordStack F (Fin 2) ι, if jointProximity … then 0 else
Pr_{γ}[…]`, and the conclusion bounds `|winningSet C δ 0 0 0 f₁ f₂|` from
below. Membership `γ ∈ winningSet C δ 0 0 0 f₁ f₂` unfolds (Definition 6.11,
`ℓ = 1`, `v = μ₁ = μ₂ = 0`) to `relaxedRelation C δ 0 0 (f₁ + γ·f₂)`, i.e.
`∃ Wstar, relation C 0 0 Wstar ∧ (f₁+γ·f₂) δ-close to Wstar`. From
`δᵣ(f₁+γ·f₂, C) ≤ δ` one extracts a close codeword `c ∈ C`, but `relation`
additionally demands `c = encode(M)` for an `F`-LINEAR `encode : (Fin k → F)
→ₗ[F] (ι → F)` with `image ⊆ C` — STRICTLY STRONGER than `c ∈ C` for an
arbitrary `Set C`.

ABF26 take `C` as the image of an explicit `F`-additive encoder; the Lean
`Set`-form `relation` faithfully encodes that but cannot let an arbitrary
close codeword satisfy it. We therefore repair the statement (in-file
precedent: the `relation`/`relaxedRelation` definitions themselves carry the
encoder existential) by hypothesising that `C` IS the image of an `F`-linear
encoder, via `hEnc`. This is exactly the regime in which the toy-problem
relation is intended (Definition 6.1: "the chosen encoding is a bijection
from `Fin k → F` onto `C`"). Under `hEnc`, `relation C 0 (fun _ ↦ 0) (fun _
↦ c)` holds for *every* `c ∈ C` (take `M` a pre-image of `c`; the linear
constraint `∑_j M·0 = 0 = μ` is vacuous at `μ = 0`), closing the wall.

Tagged proof (`paper-proof` — ABF26's OWN result, proved in §6.4.2).
The bound is in terms of `ε_ca` (correlated agreement) rather than `ε_mca`
(mutual correlated agreement); the latter would be qualitatively stronger
but no attack reaching `ε_mca > ε_ca` is currently known (Remark 6.14). -/
