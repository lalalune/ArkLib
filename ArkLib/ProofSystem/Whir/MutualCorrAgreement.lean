# Mutual Correlated Agreement for Proximity Generators

This file formalizes the notion of mutual correlated agreement for proximity generators,
introduced in Section 4 of [ACFY24].

    with Super-Fast Verification*][ACFY24]

## Implementation notes

The reference paper is phrased in terms of a minimum distance,
which should be understood as being the minimum relative hamming distance, which is used here.

/-- For `parℓ` functions `fᵢ : ι → 𝔽`, distance `δ`, generator function `GenFun: 𝔽 → parℓ → 𝔽`
    and linear code `C` the predicate `proximityCondition(r)` is true, if `∃ S ⊆ ι`, s.t.
    the following three conditions hold
      (i) `|S| ≥ (1-δ)*|ι|`
      (ii) `∃ u ∈ C, u(S) = ∑ j : parℓ, rⱼ * fⱼ(S)`
      (iii) `∃ i : parℓ, ∀ u' ∈ C, u'(S) ≠ fᵢ(S)`

  **Asymmetry with ABF26 `mcaEvent`.** Clause (iii) here is *per-row* — "some `fᵢ` is
  unmatched by any single codeword on `S`". The ABF26 `mcaEvent` (Def 4.3) instead asks
  *jointly* that "no pair `(v₀, v₁)` of codewords agrees with `(f 0, f 1)` on `S`". The
  per-row failure implies the joint failure (an unmatched row forces no joint pair) but
  not the converse: the rows could each match different codewords with no consistent
  pair. So `WHIR-event ⊆ ABF26-event` and `Pr[WHIR-event] ≤ Pr[ABF26-event]`. See
  `proximityCondition_imp_mcaEvent_affineLine` below for the predicate-level bridge. -/

/-- **One-way bridge: WHIR `proximityCondition` ⟹ ABF26 `mcaEvent` (affine-line case).**

When `parℓ = Fin 2` and `r = (1, γ)` (the affine-line generator: `r 0 = 1`, `r 1 = γ`),
the WHIR event implies the ABF26 event. As a consequence
`Pr[WHIR-event] ≤ Pr[ABF26-event]`, so any bound `epsMCA C δ ≤ ε` (ABF26-side)
transfers to a bound on WHIR's `Pr[proximityCondition]` and hence to
`hasMutualCorrAgreement (affine-line generator) BStar (fun _ => ε)`.

The converse implication does **not** hold (per-row failure is strictly stronger than
joint failure), so this bridge is one-way only. See `proximityCondition` for the
predicate-mismatch discussion.

The `δ < 1` hypothesis avoids the degenerate case where `(1 - δ)·n ≤ 0` permits an
empty witness set `S` — `proximityCondition` becomes vacuously satisfiable (its `∃ i`
clause sits inside `∀ s ∈ S` so empty `S` makes the bridge fail). -/

/-- **Probability-level corollary of the predicate bridge.** For any pair `(f 0, f 1)`,
the probability over `γ ←$ᵖ F` of WHIR's `proximityCondition` (with affine-line `r =
(1, γ)`) is bounded by ABF26's `epsMCA C δ`. Direct consequence of
`proximityCondition_imp_mcaEvent_affineLine` (predicate-level inclusion) plus the
`iSup`-definition of `epsMCA`.

Lets downstream WHIR proofs cite an ABF26-style `epsMCA C δ ≤ ε_target` bound to
discharge the WHIR `Pr_{r ←$ᵖ Gen.Gen}[proximityCondition ...] ≤ errStar δ` obligation
for the affine-line generator (where `Gen.Gen` is uniformly distributed over `F`). -/

  `Pr_{ r ← F } [ proximityCondition(r) ] ≤ errStar(δ)`.

/-- Lemma 4.10
  Let `C` be a linear code with minimum distance `δ_C`, `Gen` be a proximity generator for C
  with parameters `B` and `err`, then Gen has mutual correlated agreement with proximity bounds
  `BStar = min {1 - δ_C/2, B}` and `errStar = err`.

  ## DISPOSITION (2026-06-04): not provable as literally stated — missing proximity-gap hypothesis.

  The hypothesis "`Gen` *is* a proximity generator for `C` with parameters `B` and `err`" (i.e.
  the proximity-gap soundness `Pr_{r ←$ᵖ Gen.Gen}[proximityCondition f δ r Gen.C] ≤ Gen.err …`)
  is the load-bearing premise of the paper's Lemma 4.10, but it is recorded **nowhere**: the
  `ProximityGenerator` structure (`ProximityGen.lean`) carries `Gen`, `B`, `err` as *free data*
  with no field asserting they satisfy any proximity-gap bound. The only hypothesis supplied here
  is `hC : C = Gen.C`. So the conclusion cannot be derived.

  **Demonstrated falsity (as written).** `LinearCode` is a `Submodule`, hence `0 ∈ C`, hence
  `δᵣ(0, C) = 0 ≤ δ` for every `δ`. Instantiate `Gen.Gen := {(fun _ => 0)}` (the all-zero
  randomness tuple). Then `∑ⱼ (r j)·f j = 0`, and the (asymmetric, per-row) `proximityCondition`
  is satisfiable for the all-zero `r` whenever some `fᵢ` is not itself a codeword (clause (iii)),
  so `Pr_{r ←$ᵖ Gen.Gen}[proximityCondition …] = 1`. With any `errStar δ < 1` the bound fails.
  Both a bound-respecting and a bound-violating `(Gen.Gen, Gen.err)` are consistent with the loose
  structure, so `hasMutualCorrAgreement` cannot be forced from `hC` alone.

  **Faithful repair (not a port; intentionally not applied here).** Mirroring the `fold_f_g`
  repair, the honest fix threads the missing premise as an explicit hypothesis — the BCIKS20-style
  *correlated-agreement* soundness of `Gen` — and derives the MCA *strengthening* (the
  `min{1 - δ_C/2, B}` radius). That derivation is the genuine content of ABF26 §4 and is **not**
  available as a ported asset: the correlated-agreement → mutual-correlated-agreement machinery is
  being built concurrently in `ProximityGap/BCIKS20` / `MCAGenerator.lean` (over a *different*,
  matrix-based `Generator S ℓ F` type that is not definitionally the WHIR `ProximityGenerator`).
  Closing it requires (i) a WHIR-side restatement carrying the CA premise, and (ii) the per-row
  `proximityCondition` ↔ joint `mcaEvent` reconciliation (cf. `proximityCondition_imp_mcaEvent_…`
  above, which is one-way only). Left as an open obligation rather than fake-proved or repaired
  vacuously. See `research/formal/arklib-proof-research-2026-06.md`.

/-- Corollary 4.11
  Let `C` be a (smooth) ReedSolomon Code with rate `ρ`, then the function
  `Gen(parℓ,α)={1,α,..,α^(parℓ-1)}` is a proximity generator for Gen with
  mutual correlated agreement with proximity bounds
    `BStar = (1+ρ) / 2`
    `errStar = (parℓ-1)*2^m / ρ*|F|`.

  function `Gen(parℓ,α)={1,α,..,α ^ parℓ-1}`

  ## DISPOSITION (2026-06-04): open — genuine RS mutual-correlated-agreement bound, multi-step.

  Unlike `mca_linearCode`, here `Gen` is *pinned* to `RSGenerator.genRSC parℓ_type φ m exp`, so the
  loose-data falsity does **not** apply: `Gen.Gen` is the real Vandermonde family
  `r ↦ (j ↦ r^(exp j))` and `Gen.err` is the concrete RS error. The claimed `BStar = (1+ρ)/2`
  (unique-decoding radius) and `errStar` are the true Corollary 4.11 statement.

  The now-proven BCIKS20 machinery in this tree — `ProximityGap.proximity_gap_RSCodes`
  (`BCIKS20/ReedSolomonGap.lean`, sorry-free), the RS `(δ,ε)`-proximity gap up to the Johnson
  radius — is the right ingredient but does **not** close this directly:
  * it bounds the BCIKS20 event `δᵣ(∑ⱼ rⱼ·fⱼ, C) ≤ δ` over *affine-span* collections, whereas
    `hasMutualCorrAgreement` here uses the **asymmetric per-row** `proximityCondition` (clause (iii):
    "some `fᵢ` is unmatched by any single codeword on `S`"), a strictly different/stronger event;
  * it yields a plain proximity gap, not the *mutual correlated agreement* strengthening;
  * its `errorBound` must be reconciled with the `(parℓ-1)·2ᵐ/(ρ·|F|)` form claimed here.

  Closing this therefore needs the ABF26 §4 derivation chaining `proximity_gap_RSCodes`
  → correlated agreement → MCA, plus the per-row↔joint `proximityCondition`/`mcaEvent`
  reconciliation (the existing `Pr_proximityCondition_le_epsMCA` bridge is one-way and `epsMCA`-side
  only). That CA→MCA machinery is being built concurrently (`ProximityGap/BCIKS20`,
  `MCAGenerator.lean`); this is a multi-step formalization, not a port of existing assets, so it is
  left as an open obligation rather than fake-proved. See `research/formal/arklib-proof-research-2026-06.md`.

  The function `Gen(parℓ,α)={1,α,..,α ^ parℓ-1}` is a proximity generator with

  1. Up to Johnson bound: BStar = √ρ and

  STATUS (2025): unlike the capacity variant below, this Johnson-radius bound is NOT
  disproven and is the correct soundness bound to target for FRI/STIR/WHIR. Proving it
  requires the classical Johnson bound / list-decoding combinatorics for Reed–Solomon
  codes, which is not yet in mathlib (no Reed–Solomon, list-decoding, or Johnson-bound
  API exists upstream) — so this is a genuine ground-up formalization task, not a port.

  N.b: there is a typo in the paper, c₃ is not needed and carried over from STIR paper definition

  STATUS (2025): this *up-to-capacity* mutual-correlated-agreement conjecture was
  DISPROVEN. Three independent works (Crites–Stewart; Ben-Sasson–Carmon–Haböck–Kopparty–
  Saraf, "RS proximity gaps" 2025; Diamond–Gruen) show the correlated-agreement / MCA
  up-to-capacity bound is FALSE for some Reed–Solomon families — the failure probability
  exceeds the capacity-regime claim by Ω(1/log n) below capacity. Hence this statement is
  not merely open but unprovable as written (a `sorry` here can never be discharged by a
  correct proof). The provable replacement is the Johnson-radius variant
  `mca_johnson_bound_CONJECTURE` (BStar = √ρ), which remains the correct soundness bound
  for FRI/STIR/WHIR. See `research/formal/arklib-proof-research-2026-06.md` and

/- **Statement repair (2026-06-04):** restated `theorem … := by sorry` → `def … : Prop`.
Rationale: per the STATUS note above, this up-to-capacity claim is DISPROVEN in the
literature, so the former `sorry` was permanently undischargeable — a `theorem` shape
mis-advertises it as a pending proof obligation. As a named `Prop` it remains the
faithful record of the (refuted) conjecture, usable in hypothetical reasoning.
Blast radius: zero (no in-tree consumers; grep-verified). The provable replacement
