# Conditional `errStar` envelope: BCHKS25 T4.6 ≤ §4.5 conjecture `errStar`

**Goal.** The unconditional comparison "the BCHKS25 Theorem 4.6 RS multiplicity-coded
Johnson-range MCA bound is ≤ the ABF26 §4.5 conjecture's `errStar`" is *false*
(numerical counterexample at `η = 0.001` and large `n`, where the multiplicity `m`
pins to its floor `3` while the BCHKS bound carries an explicit `n` factor that the
conjecture bound lacks). This file isolates and proves the **η-conditional** version.

Let `ρ₊ := k/n + 1/n`, `s := √ρ₊`, and `m := max(⌈√ρ₊/(2η)⌉, 3)` (multiplicity).

* **BCHKS25 T4.6 bound** (`bchksBound`, the value inside `ENNReal.ofReal (…/q)` of
  `rs_epsMCA_johnson_range_bchks25` in `CapacityBounds.lean`, with the `1/q` factored out):

  `B := ( 2·(m+½)⁵ + 3·(m+½)·δ·ρ₊ ) / ( 3·ρ₊^{3/2} ) · n  +  (m+½)/√ρ₊`

* **§4.5 conjecture `errStar`** (`errStarNum`, the numerator of `errStarA` in
  `MCAJohnsonErrStarBounds.lean`, again with the `1/q` factored out):

  `E := (parℓ − 1)·2^{2m} / ( 2·min(1 − √ρ₊ − δ, √ρ₊/20) )⁷`

**The explicit side condition.** The load-bearing hypothesis is the *multiplicity
domination* inequality

  `26 · (m:ℝ)⁵ · n ≤ 2^{2m}`,                                        (COND)

which forces the conjecture's `2^{2m}` numerator to dominate the BCHKS `n` factor.
Because `m = max(⌈√ρ₊/(2η)⌉, 3) ≥ √ρ₊/(2η)`, (COND) is *implied by η being small
enough* — concretely `η ≤ √ρ₊ / (2·M)` forces `m ≥ M`, and `M` chosen so that
`26·M⁵·n ≤ 2^{2M}` (always possible since `2^{2M}` is eventually super-polynomial in
`M`). This is the opposite direction from a *large*-η pinning of `m`: the conditional
holds precisely when η is small enough to make the multiplicity large, which is exactly
why the η = 0.001 counterexample to the *unconditional* claim only bites once `n` is
allowed to grow with `m` floored. We expose (COND) directly as the explicit condition,
and prove the envelope `B ≤ E` from it (plus the standard regime hypotheses).

Everything below is Mathlib-only real arithmetic; no `sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`.

For `m ≥ 3`, `n ≥ 1`, `s = √ρ₊ ∈ (0,1)`, gap `δ ∈ [0, 1 − s)`, interleaving count
`parℓ ≥ 2` (i.e. `parℓ − 1 ≥ 1`), conjecture numerator `K = 2^{2m} > 0`, under the

the BCHKS25 T4.6 bound is dominated by the §4.5 conjecture `errStar`:

  `bchksBound (m+½) n δ s  ≤  errStarNum K parℓ s δ`.

Since both `rs_epsMCA_johnson_range_bchks25` and `errStarA` carry the identical `1/q`
prefactor, the same inequality holds for the full `(1/q)·(…)` bounds; the BCHKS bound
therefore *witnesses* the conjecture bound on this conditional range. -/

/-! ## Tying the side condition to an explicit bound on η

In `rs_epsMCA_johnson_range_bchks25` the multiplicity is `m = max(⌈√ρ₊/(2η)⌉, 3)`.
The two lemmas below make precise the sense in which (COND) is an **η-conditional**:
the multiplicity is an antitone function of η, so *small* η forces *large* m, and a
sufficiently large m makes (COND) hold (because `2^{2m}` outgrows `26·m⁵·n`). This is the
direction opposite to the failed unconditional claim, and exactly explains the
`η = 0.001` numerical counterexample: there the *unconditional* statement quantifies over
all `n`, and once `n` is large while `m` is read off as a fixed value the BCHKS `n` factor
wins; the conditional pins down precisely the `m`-vs-`n` budget that must hold. -/

/-- The realized multiplicity `m = max(⌈√ρ₊/(2η)⌉, 3)` always dominates the raw ratio
`√ρ₊/(2η)`. -/
lemma multiplicity_ge_ratio (s η : ℝ) :
    s / (2 * η) ≤ (max ⌈s / (2 * η)⌉ 3 : ℝ) :=
  le_trans (Int.le_ceil _) (by exact_mod_cast le_max_left ⌈s / (2 * η)⌉ (3 : ℤ))

/-- **η forces the multiplicity up.** If `η ≤ √ρ₊/(2M)` for a target `M ≥ 1` (and
`√ρ₊ > 0`, `η > 0`), then the realized multiplicity satisfies `m ≥ M`. Hence choosing
the target `M` large enough that `26·M⁵·n ≤ 2^{2M}` — always possible, since the right
side is super-polynomial in `M` — and taking `η ≤ √ρ₊/(2M)`, the side condition (COND)
holds for the realized multiplicity once one also has the monotonicity `26·m⁵·n ≤ 2^{2m}`
inherited from `m ≥ M`. -/

realized multiplicity (a real `m`) is at least `3`, and the explicit side condition (COND)

exhibit (COND) as a small-η condition: pick a target `M` with `26·M⁵·n ≤ 2^{2M}`, force
`η ≤ √ρ₊/(2M)` (so `m ≥ M`), which supplies (COND). -/
