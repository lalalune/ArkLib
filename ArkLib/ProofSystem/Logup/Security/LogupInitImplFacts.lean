# LogUp Protocol 2 — canonical `init` / `impl` data facts (issue #13, residual G-initImpl)

The LogUp Protocol 2 completeness statements
(`Logup.logup_completeness_uncond` in `LogupCompletenessUncond.lean`) are universally quantified
over the completeness initialization `init : ProbComp σ` and the shared-oracle implementation
`impl : QueryImpl oSpec (StateT σ ProbComp)`, carrying two standard *data-fact* side conditions:

* `hInit : NeverFail init` — the initialization computation never produces failure mass;
* `hImplSupp : ∀ {β} (q : OracleQuery oSpec β) s,`
    `Prod.fst <$> support ((QueryImpl.mapQuery impl q).run s) = support (liftM q)` — the oracle
    implementation is *support-faithful*: simulating a single query reproduces (on its first
    projection) exactly the support of the honest lifted query.

Because the security statements quantify over `init` / `impl`, this file discharges the two
conditions for the **canonical sampler-based instance** that any concrete LogUp completeness call
can supply, turning them from free hypotheses into proven facts:

* the canonical initialization is `pure x` (e.g. `pure () : ProbComp Unit`), whose `NeverFail` is
  immediate from `NeverFail.instPure` — packaged here as `neverFail_pure_init`;
* the canonical oracle implementation is `canonicalQueryImpl oSpec σ`, which samples each query
  uniformly over its (finite, inhabited) response range and threads the simulation state
  unchanged. Its support faithfulness is `canonicalQueryImpl_implSupp`.

## Instantiation into the LogUp statements

For any `σ` and any `init : ProbComp σ` that is a `pure` return, instantiate
`Logup.logup_completeness_uncond` (and the perfect variant) with

* `init := pure x`, `hInit := neverFail_pure_init x`;
* `impl := canonicalQueryImpl oSpec σ`, `hImplSupp := canonicalQueryImpl_implSupp oSpec σ`.

Both lemmas are stated generically over `oSpec` (with the `oSpec.Fintype` / `oSpec.Inhabited`
instances already present throughout the LogUp completeness development), so they apply verbatim to
the LogUp shared-oracle spec. The remaining LogUp residuals (`hHonest`, `hPerRound`, `hAppend`) are
genuinely-deep protocol facts and are *not* touched here.

No `sorry` / `sorryAx` / `admit`: each fact is a real proof. The axiom audit at the bottom confirms
axiom-cleanliness (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`).

never produces failure mass. This is the data fact required as `hInit : NeverFail init` by every

/-- Uniform sampler over a finite, inhabited type, landing in plain `ProbComp` (no failure layer).
Samples a uniformly random index in the inclusive range `[0, card-1]` and transports it to the type
via the canonical `Fintype.equivFin` bijection. This is the response distribution of the canonical
honest oracle implementation: full support, uniform mass. -/

/-- **The canonical sampler-based oracle implementation.** Each query `t : oSpec.Domain` is answered
by sampling uniformly from its (finite, inhabited) response range `oSpec.Range t`, with the
simulation state `σ` threaded through unchanged. This is the standard honest implementation supplied
to the LogUp completeness statements as `impl`. -/
noncomputable def canonicalQueryImpl :
    QueryImpl oSpec (StateT σ ProbComp) :=

/-! ### `hImplSupp`: the canonical implementation is support-faithful -/

/-- **Canonical `hImplSupp`.** Simulating a single oracle query under `canonicalQueryImpl` and
reading off the first projection of the support reproduces exactly the support of the honest
lifted query `liftM q`. This is the data fact required as `hImplSupp` by every LogUp completeness
statement, discharged for the canonical `impl := canonicalQueryImpl oSpec σ`.

The proof unfolds `mapQuery`, runs the lifted `StateT` sampler from state `s` (the state is left
untouched), and uses `support_uniformProbSampler` (full support of the uniform sampler) together
with `support_liftM` (`support (liftM q) = Set.range q.cont`). -/
