# LogUp Protocol 2 — the soundness converse (issue #13)

The completeness direction of LogUp is the grand-sum logarithmic-derivative identity
`grandSum_identity` (`LogupGrandSumIdentity.lean`): a **valid** lookup makes the table-side and
column-side sums-of-reciprocals coincide for every challenge `x`. Soundness needs the **converse**:
an **invalid** lookup must make a *nonzero* check polynomial, so that Schwartz–Zippel
(`logup_SZ_soundness`, which takes the nonvanishing as a premise `hQ_ne`) actually fires.

This file supplies that previously-missing converse, fully proven against the in-tree count algebra.

## The mathematics

Write `c a := lookupMultiplicityCount oStmt a` (number of lookup-column entries equal to `a`) and
`tableMultiplicityCount oStmt a` (number of table rows equal to `a`). The proven count-form lemmas
in `Common.lean` give, as rational functions of the challenge `x`,

* table side  `∑_u m(u)/(x + t(u))  =  ∑_{a : tableMultiplicityCount a > 0} c a /(x + a)`, and
* column side `∑_i ∑_u 1/(x + f_i(u)) =  ∑_{a : F} c a /(x + a)`.

Their difference is therefore `∑_{a : tableMultiplicityCount a = 0} c a /(x + a)`, supported exactly
on the values `a` that occur in some **column** but **not** in the table. Clearing the common
denominator `∏_{b : F}(x + b)` turns this into the polynomial

    grandSumCheckPoly  =  ∑_{a : F}  C (coeff a) * ∏_{b ≠ a} (X + C b),
    coeff a = if tableMultiplicityCount a = 0 then (c a : F) else 0.

**Key fact (`grandSumCheckPoly_ne_zero_of_bad_lookup`).** If the lookup is invalid there is a value
`a₀` occurring in a column but not in the table (`bad_lookup_exists_column_only_value`). Evaluating
`grandSumCheckPoly` at `-a₀` kills every summand except the `a₀` one (each other product contains the
factor `X + C a₀`, which vanishes), leaving `(c a₀ : F) * ∏_{b ≠ a₀}(b - a₀)`. The product is a
product of differences of *distinct* field elements, hence nonzero; and `(c a₀ : F) ≠ 0` because
`c a₀ ≤ M·2ⁿ < char F` — the paper's `charLarge` hypothesis is *exactly* what prevents the residue
from vanishing modulo the characteristic. So the evaluation is nonzero and the polynomial is nonzero.

This is the genuine soundness obstruction: a residue at an uncancelled pole. It is the converse
companion of `grandSum_identity`, and the nonvanishing premise that `logup_SZ_soundness` consumes.

(some lookup-column entry is not in the table range) then there is a field value `a₀` occurring in a
column (`0 < lookupMultiplicityCount`) but in no table row (`tableMultiplicityCount = 0`). This is
the value at whose pole the grand-sum identity fails. -/

/-- The cleared-denominator grand-sum **check polynomial** in the challenge variable `X`.

Its coefficient at value `a` is the column count `c a` on values *absent* from the table and `0`
on values present in the table — i.e. the numerator of `column side − table side` after clearing the
common denominator `∏_{b}(X + b)`. A valid lookup has all column values in the table, so every
coefficient vanishes and the polynomial is `0` (completeness); the converse below shows an invalid
lookup forces it nonzero. -/

`grandSumCheckPoly_ne_zero_of_bad_lookup` and confirms the coefficient encoding is faithful: nonzero
iff the lookup is invalid. -/

/-! ## The current soundness decomposition is degenerate

`Security/Soundness.lean` threads the **intermediate** language `midLanguage = Set.univ` between the
outer phase and the embedded sumcheck. That choice makes the two-way soundness split *structurally
unable* to carry the real soundness content, in two opposite ways recorded below.

* `SumcheckSoundnessResidual` is **vacuously true**: its honest-input language is
  `midLanguage = Set.univ`, and `Verifier.soundness` only quantifies over `stmtIn ∉ langIn`. There is
  no `stmtIn ∉ Set.univ`, so the obligation holds for *every* error — it carries no information.
  (Proved as `sumcheckSoundnessResidual_holds`.)

* `OuterSoundnessResidual` is correspondingly **too strong**: its accepting language is
  `midLanguage = Set.univ`, so it demands `Pr[outerVerifier outputs into Set.univ] ≤
  outerSoundnessError`, i.e. `Pr[outerVerifier accepts] ≤ outerSoundnessError`. But the outer verifier
  only performs the pole `guard`, which accepts with probability `≈ 1`; the small algebraic error
  `outerSoundnessError` cannot bound it. So this half is unprovable as stated.

The genuine LogUp soundness argument needs a **nontrivial** `midLanguage`: the set of intermediate
statements whose embedded-sumcheck *claim is true*. With that relation, the SZ obstruction
`grandSumCheckPoly_ne_zero_of_bad_lookup` above bounds `Pr[bad input ↦ true claim]` (the outer half),
and the sumcheck soundness bounds `Pr[false claim ↦ accept]` (the sumcheck half). Both then carry
real content. This is the architectural fix the soundness residual surface still needs; the algebraic
heart of the outer half is now in hand. -/

/-- **The sumcheck soundness half is vacuous.** Because `midLanguage = Set.univ`, the honest-input
side of `SumcheckSoundnessResidual` quantifies over `stmtIn ∉ Set.univ`, of which there are none, so
the residual holds for *every* error term. This discharges the second conjunct of
`SubPhaseSoundnessResidual` unconditionally — but, as the section docstring explains, only because the
chosen `midLanguage` is degenerate, not because real sumcheck soundness has been established. -/
