# LogUp Soundness

Main soundness statement for Protocol 2 of `paper.txt`.

## Proof architecture and the named residual

`logupVerifier` is *definitionally* the sequential composition
`OracleVerifier.append outerVerifier sumcheckVerifier` (see `logupVerifier_eq_append`). Soundness
therefore follows from `OracleVerifier.append_soundness` (the generic sequential-composition
probability lemma, whose `AppendCoherent` side condition for `outerVerifier` is the in-tree
`instOuterVerifierAppendCoherent`), supplying:

* outer-phase soundness for `outerVerifier`, with intermediate language `midLanguage` and error
  `outerSoundnessError` (the two LogUp algebraic-check terms), and
* embedded-sumcheck soundness for `sumcheckVerifier`, with error `sumcheckSoundnessError`.

These two sub-verifier soundness facts are collected into the named residual
`subPhaseSoundness`, and the top-level `logup_soundness` is reduced to it through
`OracleVerifier.append_soundness` in `logup_soundness_of_residual` (no `sorry`). For callers that
can discharge only one side at a time, `Security/SubPhaseSplit.lean` exposes the same residual as
the independent halves `OuterSoundnessResidual` and `SumcheckSoundnessResidual`. The error
reconciliation `outerSoundnessError + sumcheckSoundnessError = logupSoundnessError …` holds by
`rfl` because `logupSoundnessError` is *defined* as that sum.

## What blocks `subPhaseSoundness`

Both sub-facts are blocked by missing upstream security lemmas introduced *outside*
`ArkLib/ProofSystem/Logup/**`, which this development is not permitted to modify:

* No outer LogUp verifier soundness theorem for `outerVerifier` exists in-tree (the algebraic
  pole/grand-sum checks of Protocol 2).
* The embedded sumcheck soundness for `sumcheckVerifier` is a `liftContext` of
  `Sumcheck.Spec.oracleVerifier`. The generic sumcheck development currently provides single-round
  completeness and round-by-round knowledge-soundness infrastructure, but no full plain soundness
  theorem for `Sumcheck.Spec.oracleVerifier` at the shape needed here, and the lift also requires
  the `logupSumcheckContextLens` / `logupSumcheckOracleLens` soundness conditions.
* `OracleVerifier.append_soundness` currently exposes the sequential-composition soundness theorem
  as an explicit `hAppendSoundness` hypothesis. This keeps the obstruction as a named residual
  interface instead of hiding it behind `sorryAx`.

Hence this residual remains explicit, with a split front door in `Security/SubPhaseSplit.lean` for
the outer and sumcheck halves. The final output language is `Set.univ` (`outputRelation_language`),
so this is a nontrivial acceptance-probability bound, not a vacuous language inclusion.

/-- The two sub-phase soundness obligations of the LogUp composition, stated as a single named
`Prop` residual (not proved here).

* The outer phase (`outerVerifier`) is sound with intermediate language `midLanguage` and error
  `outerSoundnessError F n M params`.
* The embedded sumcheck (`sumcheckVerifier`) is sound with error `sumcheckSoundnessError`.

WALL (upstream security/composition gaps, outside `ArkLib/ProofSystem/Logup/**`, not modifiable
here): no in-tree outer LogUp soundness theorem; no full plain `Sumcheck.Spec` soundness theorem at
the lifted shape; and `OracleVerifier.append_soundness` carries the append-soundness theorem as an
explicit hypothesis. See the module docstring.

This is therefore kept as an explicit named residual `Prop` (no `sorry`); the main theorem
`logup_soundness_of_residual` consumes it. -/

`SubPhaseSoundnessResidual` through the genuine sequential-composition soundness interface
`OracleVerifier.append_soundness` (whose append theorem is an explicit residual hypothesis; see the

The soundness error `logupSoundnessError F n M params s = outerSoundnessError F n M params + s`
is exactly the `soundnessError₁ + soundnessError₂` produced by `append_soundness`. This reduction's
own body contains no `sorry`. -/
