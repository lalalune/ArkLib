# LogUp Completeness

Main completeness statement for Protocol 2 of `paper.txt`.

## Proof architecture and the upstream `sorryAx` wall

`logupOracleReduction` is *definitionally* the sequential composition
`outerOracleReduction.append sumcheckOracleReduction` (see `logupOracleReduction_eq_append`).
Completeness therefore follows from `OracleReduction.append_completeness`, supplying:

* outer-phase completeness with error `logupCompletenessError F n` (the pole-rejection error,
  whose mathematical content is the genuinely-proven `card_poleSet_le` / `probEvent_pole_le`
  below: a uniformly sampled `x : F` hits a table pole `-t(u)` with probability at most
  `|Hypercube n| / |F|`), and
* embedded-sumcheck completeness with error `0` (the honest sumcheck run is deterministic and
  correct).

Both sub-facts, and the composition lemma `OracleReduction.append_completeness` itself, are blocked
by `sorryAx` introduced *outside* `ArkLib/ProofSystem/Logup/**`, which this development is not
permitted to modify:

* `OracleVerifier.Append.emitOStmt₂Query`
  (`ArkLib/OracleReduction/Composition/Sequential/Append.lean:277`) is a `sorry` — the
  "instance-coherence gap (#433)" for routing the first verifier's output-oracle queries. Because
  `logupVerifier = OracleVerifier.append outerVerifier sumcheckVerifier` and the generic sumcheck
  verifier `Sumcheck.Spec.oracleVerifier` is itself `OracleVerifier.seqCompose` (built recursively
  from `OracleVerifier.append`), `logupOracleReduction` *itself* depends on `sorryAx`. Any theorem
  whose statement mentions `logupOracleReduction` consequently reports `sorryAx`, independent of how
  it is proved.
* `Reduction.append_completeness`
  (`ArkLib/OracleReduction/Composition/Sequential/Append.lean:1097`) is a `sorry`; the oracle-level
  `OracleReduction.append_completeness` reduces to it.
* `Sumcheck.Spec.oracleVerifier` / `Sumcheck.Spec.oracleReduction` carry `sorryAx` via the same
  `OracleVerifier.append` route, so embedded-sumcheck completeness is not yet provable in-tree.

Consequently `logup_completeness` is closed via the genuine composition skeleton, with a single
residual `sorry` (`subPhaseCompleteness`) standing for the two upstream-blocked sub-completeness
facts. The pole-probability lemmas it relies on are fully proven (no `sorryAx`).

/-- Completeness error forced by the current rejection-based model of the `x` challenge.

Protocol 2 samples `x` from the complement of the table poles. The current verifier samples from
all of `F` and rejects poles, so the intended completeness statement carries this explicit bad-`x`
probability. Once the challenge sampler is modeled as the complement distribution, this should
collapse to perfect completeness.

The numerator `|Hypercube n|` is exactly the pole count bounded by `card_poleSet_le`.

/-- The two sub-phase completeness obligations of the LogUp composition.

* The outer phase (`outerOracleReduction`) is complete with error `logupCompletenessError F n`: its
  honest run is deterministic and correct except when the sampled `x` is one of the at most
  `|Hypercube n|` table poles (see `probEvent_pole_le`); the verifier's pole-rejection `guard` then
  fails.
* The embedded sumcheck (`sumcheckOracleReduction`) is complete with error `0`.

WALL (upstream `sorryAx`, outside `ArkLib/ProofSystem/Logup/**`, not modifiable here):

* Outer completeness requires unfolding `Reduction.run (outerOracleReduction …)`. The prover and
  verifier of the outer phase are themselves `sorryAx`-free, and the failure event is exactly the
  pole event bounded by `probEvent_pole_le`. This direction is in principle closable in-tree but is
  not finished here.
* Sumcheck completeness is blocked: `sumcheckOracleReduction` is a `liftContext` of
  `Sumcheck.Spec.oracleReduction`, whose verifier `Sumcheck.Spec.oracleVerifier` is built from
  `OracleVerifier.seqCompose`/`OracleVerifier.append` and depends on the `sorry` at
  `ArkLib/OracleReduction/Composition/Sequential/Append.lean:277`
  (`OracleVerifier.Append.emitOStmt₂Query`). No `Sumcheck.Spec` completeness theorem exists in-tree.

Hence this single residual `sorry`. -/

Reduced to `subPhaseCompleteness` through the genuine sequential-composition completeness lemma
`OracleReduction.append_completeness` (itself upstream-blocked by `sorryAx`; see the module
docstring). The completeness error `logupCompletenessError F n = |Hypercube n| / |F|` is the sum
