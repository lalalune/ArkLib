# Keystone capstone — the `hcoeffPoly` witness for the Johnson list-decoding branch

This file is the **top of the bottom-up grind** of the BCIKS20 §5 proximity-gap keystone.  It
assembles, as a finite composition of the verified `ArkLib/ToMathlib/` bricks, the standalone
witness `hcoeffPoly` consumed by the list-decoding front door

  `ProximityGap.RS_jointAgreement_of_prob_gt_and_errorBound_lower_bounds`  (Curves.lean:1199)

whose `hcoeffPoly` hypothesis (Curves.lean:1214-1222) is, verbatim:

  `∀ P : F → Polynomial F,`
  `  (∀ z ∈ RS_goodCoeffsCurve u δ, (P z).natDegree < deg ∧ δᵣ(…, (P z).eval ∘ domain) ≤ δ) →`
  `  ∃ B : ℕ → Polynomial F,`
  `    (∀ j < deg, (B j).natDegree < k + 1) ∧`
  `    ∀ z ∈ RS_goodCoeffsCurve u δ, ∀ j < deg, (P z).coeff j = (B j).eval z`

i.e. the §5 statement *"each coefficient of the decoded curve polynomial is itself a polynomial of
degree `< k+1` in the curve parameter `z`, over the good set."*

## What this capstone proves, and what stays an explicit hypothesis

The verified-brick chain (all kernel-clean, `#print axioms = [propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound]`) closes the **abstract function-field core** of §5:

  `betaRec` (App-A.4 recursion, defined+terminating+lands-in-𝒪, `BetaRecursion`)
    → `betaRec_weight_le_concrete ≤ (2t+1)·d_R·D`        (`BetaWeightInduction` + `BetaWeightCollapse`)
    → `betaRec_matchingVanishes` (Hensel uniqueness)      (`BetaMatchingVanishes` + `CoeffExtract`)
    → `embeddingOf𝒪Into𝕃 (betaRec t) = 0`                 (`IngredientCBridge`, ingredient C)
    → curve `γ` is linear-in-`Z`, coefficients per-point   (`Claim59Conditional`/`Claim510Conditional`)

The chain bottoms out, per the grind ledger's authoritative final state, on a **single genuine §5
math datum** (shared by obligations (1)+(4)): the Guruswami–Sudan interpolant's
multiplicity-vanishing at the centre, valid in the Johnson radius `δ ≤ δ₀`; plus a handful of in-tree
degree facts.  The remaining work to *physically* reach Curves.lean:1819 is the cross-file `L13`
drop-in (replacing the trivial in-tree `β_regular` with `betaRec` inside `RationalFunctions.lean`)
and the `F1` recentering fix — both edits to live-session-owned files, deferred by design.

This capstone therefore packages the §5 list-decoding output as **one explicit bridge hypothesis**
— the per-coefficient curve-polynomial datum `hCurvePolys` (exactly what the abstract chain produces:
each coefficient index `j` carries a degree-`< k+1` interpolant agreeing on the good set) — and
*proves*, kernel-clean with no `sorry`, that it yields the bundled `hcoeffPoly` witness and hence
`jointAgreement`.  The honest measure of "how close the verified-brick composition reaches
Curves:1819" is precisely: the conclusion is the real front-door goal, and the *only* residual
hypotheses are the §5 multiplicity datum (`δ ≤ δ₀` regime) + standard degree facts, repackaged as
`hCurvePolys`.

No part claimed proven contains `sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`; every genuine gap is an explicit
hypothesis.

/-! ## The §5 list-decoding output, as an explicit bridge datum

`CurveCoeffPolys` is the conclusion of the BCIKS §5 list-decoding section in the form the front door
needs: for a candidate decoding `P : F → Polynomial F` of the curve, **every** coefficient index
`j < deg` is interpolated, *over the good set*, by a single polynomial `B j` of degree `< k+1`.

This is exactly what the verified abstract chain produces.  Concretely, ingredient C
(`IngredientC.embedding_eq_zero_of_matchingSet_large`) forces `embeddingOf𝒪Into𝕃 β = 0`, whence
Claims 5.9/5.10 (`Claim59Conditional.gamma_linear_in_Z_of_tail_zero`,
`Claim510.gamma_matches_word_concrete`) give the per-point linear-in-`Z` structure of the decoded
curve; the `(X − x₀)^t` coefficient reading (`CoeffExtract.coeff_extract_betaRec`) is what turns the
abstract vanishing into the scalar coefficient identities.  Generalising the line case (`k = 1`) to
arbitrary degree `< k+1` gives one interpolant `B j` per coefficient index `j`.

We keep this as a `Prop`-level datum so the capstone is a *finite composition under one explicit
regime hypothesis*, never a `sorry`. -/

/-! ## Bundling: per-index curve polynomials ⟹ the front-door `hcoeffPoly` shape

The front door wants a *single* `B : ℕ → Polynomial F` with the joint degree-and-eval conclusion.
`CurveCoeffPolys` gives one interpolant per index; we bundle them via choice into the required `B`.
This is genuine (non-`sorry`) Lean content: assembling the indexed existentials into one function
and discharging both the degree bound and the eval identity simultaneously. -/

/-! ## The old front-door output shape

`Section55CurveCoeffOutput` packages the literal output shape of the list-decoding branch: for
**every** candidate decoding `P` of the curve that is good on the good set (each `P z` of degree
`< deg` and within radius `δ`), the per-coefficient curve polynomials exist (`CurveCoeffPolys`).
This is exactly the front-door `hcoeffPoly` obligation, so it is not the canonical residual
input for the finished keystone path. The smaller current route is
`KeystoneAssembly.keystone_of_section5Inputs`, whose residual is the corrected
`Section5StrictDataFin` producer bundle.

Historically this capstone described the remaining §5 work as:

* `hMult` — the Guruswami–Sudan interpolant's multiplicity-vanishing at the centre
  (in-tree `ModifiedGuruswami.Q_multiplicity` / `gsQ_multiplicity`), the single genuine §5 datum;
* `hδ₀`  — the Johnson radius condition `δ ≤ δ₀` under which that multiplicity holds;
* degree facts (`d_H ≤ d_R ≤ D`, available in-tree from `weight_ξ_bound`/`hH`).

Those facts are now routed through smaller producer bundles elsewhere; this file keeps the old
output-shaped proposition only as a compatibility target for the front-door bundling lemmas. -/

/-! ## The capstone: `hcoeffPoly` from the old output-shaped target

This compatibility lemma confirms that the old output-shaped proposition is exactly enough to feed
the front-door `hcoeffPoly` hypothesis (Curves.lean:1214-1222). It should not be mistaken for the
canonical residual input; use `KeystoneAssembly.keystone_of_section5Inputs` for the smaller producer
interface. -/

/-! ## End-to-end: `jointAgreement` through the front door

To confirm the capstone's conclusion is exactly the front-door `hcoeffPoly`, we feed it to
`ProximityGap.RS_jointAgreement_of_prob_gt_and_errorBound_lower_bounds` (Curves.lean:1199) and obtain
`jointAgreement`.  This type-checks the capstone against the *real* keystone front door: every
hypothesis other than `hcoeffPoly` is the standard probability-threshold input the front door already
takes (`hprob`, `hεsmall`, `hεlarge`), so the list-decoding branch of Curves:1819 is, under
`Section55CurveCoeffOutput`, a front-door compatibility check. -/
