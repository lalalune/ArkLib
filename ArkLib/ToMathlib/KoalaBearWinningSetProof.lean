# The concrete KoalaBear winning-set residual is a structural obstruction (`#106`)

The leaderboard axiom `ToyProblem.fenziSanso_upperBound_attack_concrete_residual` asks for a
**violating instance** of the genuine concrete KoalaBear-sextic carrier
(`KoalaBear.rsCodeSet`, the rate-`1/2` Reed–Solomon code over `Fin 4`) whose winning set has at
least `2^70` challenges.

This file proves the *structural core* showing that residual is **unsatisfiable at the concrete
carrier**: over this `[n = 4, k = 2]` code the winning set of the simplified-IOR attack is governed
by a sharp dichotomy, and in the **violating** regime it is **tiny** (at most `C(4,3) = 4`
challenges) — never `2^70`.

## The geometry

The concrete code is the `[n = 4, k = 2]` Reed–Solomon code: codewords are evaluations
`j ↦ m₀ + m₁ · j` of affine polynomials at the four points `0,1,2,3 ∈ F_{p^6}`. Its minimum
distance is `n − k + 1 = 3` (`KoalaBear.hammingDist_rsEncoder_ge_three`, proved for `#107`), so:

* **two points determine a codeword** (`KoalaBear.rsEncoder_agree_two_points_imp_eq`); and
* at `δ = 3/10` over `|ι| = 4`, the relaxed-relation agreement threshold is
  `⌈(1 − 3/10)·4⌉ = ⌈2.8⌉ = 3` coordinates.

A challenge `γ` is **winning** only if the line `f₁ + γ·f₂` agrees with *some* codeword on a
`3`-subset `T ⊆ Fin 4`. The codeword restrictions to a fixed `T` form a `2`-dimensional subspace
`V_T ⊆ F^T`; the affine line `{f₁|_T + γ·f₂|_T : γ}` is `1`-dimensional, so it meets `V_T` in **at
most one point** unless it lies entirely inside `V_T`. The contained case means `f₁|_T` and `f₂|_T`
are *both* codeword restrictions on the *same* `T` — exactly a common agreement set realising the
relaxed two-row relation `R̃²`, i.e. the instance is **not** violating.

Hence, for a violating instance, each of the four `3`-subsets contributes at most one winning
challenge: `|Ω| ≤ 4 < 2^70`.

## What is proven here (axiom-clean)

* `KoalaBear.two_winning_same_subset_imp_lineInCode` — the **geometric heart**: if two *distinct*
  challenges both put the line `f₁ + γ·f₂` onto codewords along a common coordinate set `T`, then
  both `f₁|_T` and `f₂|_T` are codeword restrictions on `T` (the "line lies in `V_T`" conclusion).
  Pure `F`-linearity of `rsEncoder`.
* `KoalaBear.winning_pair_eq_of_common_subset` — its consequence on a **distinguishing** subset:
  over two distinct coordinates of a common agreement set, no two distinct challenges can both win,
  *unless* `f₁`, `f₂` are jointly codeword-restricted there (the non-violating escape). This is the
  "at most one winning challenge per subset" fact underlying the `|Ω| ≤ 4` bound.

The minimum-distance input is reused from `ArkLib/ToMathlib/KoalaIRSAccounting.lean`
(`KoalaBear.rsEncoder_agree_two_points_imp_eq`, `#107`). The remaining wrapper — turning
"line in `V_T`" into a populated `relaxedRelation (ℓ := 2)` witness (hence contradicting
`x.violates`) and counting the four subsets to `|Ω| ≤ 4` — additionally requires reconstructing the
existential constraint-encoding of `relation` and is tracked on `#106`.

/-- **The geometric heart of the `#106` obstruction (line-in-code).**

Suppose two *distinct* challenges `γ ≠ γ'` both make the line `f₁ + γ·f₂` land on a Reed–Solomon
codeword along a common coordinate set `T` (the winning agreement set): there are messages
`mc, mc'` with `rsEncoder mc` agreeing with `f₁ + γ·f₂` on `T` and `rsEncoder mc'` agreeing with
`f₁ + γ'·f₂` on `T`. Then *both* `f₁|_T` and `f₂|_T` are themselves codeword restrictions on `T`:
there are messages `a, b` with `rsEncoder a` agreeing with `f₁` on `T` and `rsEncoder b` agreeing
with `f₂` on `T`.

This is exactly "the affine line `{f₁|_T + γ·f₂|_T}` lies inside the codeword-restriction subspace
`V_T`". Two distinct winning challenges on a *common* `T` therefore force a *common* two-row
agreement set — the structural reason a **violating** instance can win on each `3`-subset at most
once, capping its winning set at `C(4,3) = 4 < 2^70`.

The proof is pure `F`-linearity of `rsEncoder` (no minimum-distance input needed): set
`b := (γ − γ')⁻¹ • (mc − mc')` and `a := mc − γ • b`. -/

/-- **At most one winning challenge per agreement subset, unless the line lies in the code.**

If two *distinct* challenges `γ ≠ γ'` both win along a common coordinate set `T` that contains two
*distinct* coordinates `i₁ ≠ i₂` (witnessed by codewords `rsEncoder mc`, `rsEncoder mc'`), then the
line `f₁ + γ·f₂` is forced into the code on `T`: there is a single message `b` with `rsEncoder b`
agreeing with `f₂` on the two coordinates `i₁, i₂` — and, by minimum distance, that codeword is the
*unique* `2`-point interpolant of `f₂|_{i₁,i₂}`. Symmetrically for `f₁`. In other words, a violating
instance (which by definition admits *no* common `3`-subset agreement) cannot have two distinct
winning challenges sharing a common agreement set of size `≥ 2` — the core counting input behind
`|Ω| ≤ C(4,3) = 4`. -/
