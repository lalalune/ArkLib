# Substitution Caveats for Power Series over Fields

This module analyzes the algebraic conditions under which the power series substitution operator
`PowerSeries.subst` is well-defined. In particular, we formalize the condition that substitution
into a power series over a field requires the substituted series to have a constant coefficient
of zero (i.e., a positive order).

## Mathematical Formulation

Let $K$ be a field, and let $g(X) \in K[[X]]$ be a power series. Mathlib defines the substitution
operator $f(g(X))$ for $f \in K[[X]]$ to be well-defined if the constant coefficient of $g$
is nilpotent, which is packaged as the `PowerSeries.HasSubst` predicate.

Over a field $K$, the only nilpotent element is zero. Therefore, we have the equivalence:
$$\text{HasSubst}(g) \iff \text{constantCoeff}(g) = 0$$

In the context of the BCIKS substitution $X \mapsto X - x_0$ used in Hensel lifting, the
shift series is
$$g(X) = -x_0 + X$$
If the field is $K = \mathbb{L}_H$, which contains the base field $F$, the constant
coefficient is $0$ if and only if $x_0 = 0$. For any off-center point $x_0 \neq 0$, the
substitution operator is not well-defined under the standard Mathlib definition.

## Key Formalizations
* `hasSubst_iff_constantCoeff_eq_zero_of_field`: Pointwise equivalence of the substitution
  condition to a zero constant coefficient over a field.
* `constantCoeff_shiftSeries`: Computes the constant coefficient of the shift series.
* `hasSubst_shiftSeries_iff_eq_zero`: Shows that the BCIKS shift series is substitutable if
  and only if the expansion center is $0$.

/-! ### The substitution-free recentering description (F1)

`SubstFieldCaveat` above shows the BCIKS shift series is `PowerSeries.subst`-substitutable
**iff** `x₀ = 0`.  For an off-center expansion (`x₀ ≠ 0`) the keystone must therefore avoid
`PowerSeries.subst`.  The substitution-free route is the *polynomial recentering*
`Polynomial.aeval (shiftSeries x₀ H) p`: this is the value of the numerator polynomial `p`
at the series `X - x₀` and is well-defined for **every** `x₀` (no `HasSubst`/nilpotent-constant
requirement), because evaluating a *finite* polynomial needs no convergence condition.  When the
numerator is tail-zero (the genuine `betaRec` output), it *is* such a finite polynomial
(`PowerSeries.trunc k (mk α)`), so this is the correct off-center replacement for the invalid
`(mk α).subst (shiftSeries x₀ H)`.

The two facts below make that precise and show the affine-curve (linear) structure is preserved
under recentering — exactly the `degreeX ≤ 1` payload the curve-coefficient extraction reads off. -/

/-- **Recentering preserves the affine-curve (linear) structure.**  Applying the off-center
shift `aeval (shiftSeries x₀ H) ·` to a linear numerator `C a + b·X` returns the linear series
`C (a − b·x₀) + b·X`: the `X`-coefficient `b` is unchanged and only the constant term is shifted.
This is the substitution-free, all-`x₀` version of the `degreeX ≤ 1` preservation consumed by the
curve-coefficient-polynomial extraction. -/
