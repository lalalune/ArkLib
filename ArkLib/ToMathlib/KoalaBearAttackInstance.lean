# Issue #339 — `fenziSanso_upperBound_attack_concrete_residual` is TRUE:
the full-field winning set via the constraint degeneracy

This module **proves** the leaderboard's concrete attack residual by exhibiting a violating
instance over the genuine KoalaBear-sextic `[4,2]` Reed–Solomon code whose winning set is
**all of `F = F_{p^6}`** (`ncard = p^6 ≈ 2^186 ≥ 2^70`).

**The mechanism (honest disclosure).**  This is NOT the paper's list-decoding attack
(Fenzi–Sanso eprint 2025/2197 Lemma 4.4 — large lists do not exist at `δ = 3/10` for this
length-4 carrier).  It is a *constraint-degeneracy* exploit available in the in-tree
`relaxedRelation` model (Definition 6.3), whose encoding is existential with only
`∀ m, encode m ∈ C`:

* the instance: `f₁ = c₁ + bump`, `f₂ = c₂ + bump` at the last coordinate, with `c₁, c₂` the
  constant-`1` and identity codewords, `v = (1, 0) ≠ 0`, `μ₁ = μ₂ = 0`;
* **every `γ` wins**: the fold agrees with the codeword `c₁ + γ·c₂` on `{0,1,2}` (3 of 4
  coordinates, `(1 − 3/10)·4 = 2.8 ≤ 3`), realised by the rank-one encode
  `m ↦ m 1 • (c₁ + γ·c₂)` with message `(0,1)`, whose constraint
  `⟨(0,1), v⟩ = 0 = μ₁ + γ·μ₂` holds;
* **the instance violates the 2-row relation**: a common agreement set of size ≥ 3 contains
  two unbumped coordinates, forcing the close pair to `(c₁, c₂)` by affine interpolation;
  the zero constraints force `M i 0 = 0`, hence `c₁ = t₀ • E(0,1)` and `c₂ = t₁ • E(0,1)`
  are proportional — contradicting `c₁ 0 = 1, c₂ 0 = 0, c₂ 1 = 1`.

Via `fenziSanso_upperBound_attack_residual_of_concrete`, this discharges TWO of the three
#339 residuals.  The model-level finding is the honest content: the in-tree relaxed relation
is strictly more permissive than the paper's fixed-encoding `R_C` (single-row constraint
values are free at any nonzero close codeword under rank-one re-encoding, while zero
constraints on an independent close pair are unsatisfiable under any common encode), and the
leaderboard's 116-bit attack anchor is validated by that permissiveness — not by
list-decoding.
