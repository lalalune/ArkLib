# GGR11 interleaved-code list-size recursion — residual reduction

This file isolates the **single external obstruction** behind ABF26 Lemma 2.10
(= Gopalan–Guruswami–Raghavendra 2011, "List Decoding Tensor Products and
Interleaved Codes", RANDOM 2011) so that `lambda_le_ggr11` in
`ArkLib.Data.CodingTheory.InterleavedCode` can be discharged *modulo a single,
precisely named combinatorial hypothesis* with **no `sorry` and no `axiom`** in
the reduction itself.

## The theorem

Let `C ⊆ (ι → F)` be a code with relative minimum distance `δ_C := δ_min(C)/|ι|`,
and `δ ∈ [0, δ_C)`. With `η := δ_C - δ`, `b := ⌈δ/η⌉`, `r := ⌈log₂(δ_C/η)⌉`,
GGR11 / ABF26 L2.10 states, for every `m ≥ 1`,

  `|Λ(C^{≡m}, δ)| ≤ (b+r choose r) · |Λ(C, δ)|^r`.   (★)

## What is in-tree, what is the residual

`ArkLib.Data.CodingTheory.InterleavedListSize` proves, fully `sorry`-free, the
elementary `m`-*dependent* bound

  `|Λ(C^{≡m}, δ)| ≤ |Λ(C, δ)|^m`   (the per-column product bound),

via the injection `V ↦ (V.transpose ·)` of a close interleaved codeword into the
product of its per-column base-code lists.  That is the deepest in-tree-reachable
statement: it uses only the row/column projection lemmas.

The improvement of (★) over the product bound is the replacement of the exponent
`m` by the `m`-*independent* `r = ⌈log₂(δ_C/η)⌉`, together with the `(b+r choose
r)` prefactor.  Achieving `m`-independence is exactly the GGR11 list-recovery /
column-pruning recursion: of the `m` columns, only `r` "pivot" columns carry
independent list freedom (a budget/covering argument over the `b`-bounded
agreement deficits), and the joint list embeds into the product of the per-pivot
lists.  ArkLib presently has **no list-recovery primitive and no column-pruning /
iterated-projection lemma**, so this step is a genuine external-paper wall, not a
missing local proof.

We therefore name precisely that wall — the per-received-word form of (★) — as
`GGR11PerWordBound`, and prove that it implies (★) for the maximised `Lambda`.
This converts the live `sorry` into a single, auditable named hypothesis.

## Edge cases discharged unconditionally

`lambda_le_ggr11` itself (in `InterleavedCode.lean`) already closes the
infinite-list case `Λ(C, δ) = ⊤` completely (the RHS is then `⊤`).  Here we also
record `lambda_le_ggr11_of_perWordBound`, the finite-regime reduction.

## The closed-form combinatorics is now in-tree (NEW)

GGR11 §3 splits into two parts:

* **(Tree construction.)** Build `Tree(R)`, the Erase-Decode tree (Algorithm 1).
  Its number of leaves bounds the per-word list size.  After contracting White
  edges (Lemma 3.3: a White edge is the *only* edge out of its node), every node
  has at most **one** Blue out-edge (Lemma 3.4) and at most `|Λ(C,δ)|` Red
  out-edges; every root→leaf path has at most `b` Blue edges (Lemma 3.4) and at
  most `r` Red edges (Lemma 3.5).  This is the list-recovery / erasure-decoding
  content that has **no in-tree analogue**.

* **(Leaf counting.)** A tree with those per-node and per-path budgets has at
  most `(b+r choose r)·|Λ(C,δ)|^r` leaves (Theorem 3.6), via the recursion
  `t(b,r) ≤ t(b-1,r) + L·t(b,r-1)`, base `t(b,0) = 1`.

We now prove the **second** part fully (`ggr11_tree_count_le`, no `sorry`/`axiom`),
and refactor the residual so that it names *only the first part* — the existence
of a leaf-count function satisfying the GGR11 budget recursion that dominates the
actual close set (`GGR11TreeStructure`).  The chain

  `GGR11TreeStructure → GGR11PerWordBound → lambda_le_ggr11`

is then fully proven (`perWordBound_of_treeStructure`,
`lambda_le_ggr11_of_perWordBound`).  This shrinks the named external surface from
"the whole §3 recursion incl. the closed-form `choose` bound" down to "the
Erase-Decode tree exists with the stated Blue/Red budgets".

/-- **The GGR11 residual (per-received-word form).**

For a fixed received interleaved word `f : Matrix ι (Fin m) F`, the number of
interleaved codewords `δ`-close to `f` is at most `(b+r choose r) · |Λ(C,δ)|^r`,
with `r` (and `b`) the GGR11 exponent/prefactor — **independent of `m`**.

This is exactly the content GGR11 §3 establishes by the list-recovery /
column-pruning recursion described in the module docstring.  It is stated as an
`encard` bound so that it is meaningful over an arbitrary (possibly infinite)
field `F`, with no `Fintype F` assumption: when a per-column list is infinite the
hypothesis is vacuously informative on the `⊤` side, and the genuine content is
the finite case.

We do **not** prove this here: it is the named external obstruction. -/

/-! ### The GGR11 leaf-counting recursion (Theorem 3.6) — fully in-tree -/

/-- **GGR11 Theorem 3.6, leaf-counting bound (no external input).**

Let `L : ℕ∞` be a per-node Red branching bound (in the application,
`L = Λ(C,δ)`).  Suppose `t b r : ℕ∞` is *any* upper bound on the number of leaves
of a rooted tree in which

* every root→leaf path has at most `b` Blue and `r` Red edges,
* every node has at most one Blue out-edge and at most `L` Red out-edges,

encoded by the three structural inequalities below (`hbase`: a tree with no Red
budget has a single leaf; `hrec0`: the Red-only column branches by `≤ L`;
`hrec`: Pascal's recursion `t(b,r) ≤ t(b-1,r) + L·t(b,r-1)`).  Then

  `t b r ≤ (b+r choose r) · L^r`.

This is the entire combinatorial content of GGR11 Theorem 3.6, proved here with
**no `sorry` and no `axiom`** by the double induction the paper indicates
("It is easy to check that `t(b, r) ≤ (b+r choose r)·ℓ^r`"). -/

/-! ### The refined residual: only the Erase-Decode tree existence -/

/-- **The GGR11 residual, refined to tree existence only.**

For a fixed received interleaved word `f`, there exists a leaf-count function
`t : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ∞` such that the close-codeword set is dominated by `t b r`, and `t`
obeys the GGR11 Erase-Decode budget recursion with Red branching factor
`L = Λ(C,δ)` (cf. `ggr11_tree_count_le`).

This is **strictly smaller** than `GGR11PerWordBound`: it names only the existence
of the Erase-Decode tree with the Blue/Red budgets of GGR11 Lemmas 3.3–3.5 (the
list-recovery / erasure-decoding content with no in-tree analogue), and **drops**
the closed-form `(b+r choose r)·L^r` combinatorics, which is now the proved lemma
`ggr11_tree_count_le`. -/

When `m ≤ r` and `1 ≤ Λ(C,δ)`, the in-tree product bound
`encard ≤ Λ(C,δ)^m` already supplies a GGR11 Erase-Decode tree: take the explicit
leaf-count `t b' r' := Λ(C,δ)^{r'}` (a tree of pure Red depth, which trivially
meets all the Blue/Red budgets), which dominates the close set because
`Λ(C,δ)^m ≤ Λ(C,δ)^r = t b r`.  This shows `GGR11TreeStructure` is **not
vacuous** and is consistent with the in-tree elementary product bound; it is the
complementary `m > r` regime (where `t b' r' := Λ^{r'}` no longer dominates) that
needs the genuine GGR11 erasure-decoding construction. -/
