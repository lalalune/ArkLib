/-! # Coefficients of power-series substitutions and γ-truncation bookkeeping

This file collects clean, generic lemmas about `PowerSeries.subst` and `PowerSeries.coeff`
needed for the "γ-truncation" bookkeeping in the BCIKS20 Appendix-A list-decoding argument
(brick **L6** of the proximity-prize DAG).

The geometric situation is: `γ = PowerSeries.subst g (PowerSeries.mk α)` where `g` is a power
series with zero constant coefficient (in the application `g = X - x₀` as a power series, more
precisely the relevant shift series has positive *order*, so `g = X * h`).  Claims 5.8'/5.9 consume
two facts about such a `γ`:

* the degree-`< k` part of `γ` depends only on finitely many of the `α`-coefficients
  (`coeff_subst_eq_sum_range`, `coeff_subst_congr_of_coeff_eq`,
  `trunc_subst_eq_trunc_subst_coe_trunc`);
* if `α t = 0` for all `t ≥ k`, then `γ` *is* the substitution of a polynomial of degree `< k`,
  hence a truncation (`subst_eq_subst_coe_trunc_of_coeff_eq_zero`,
  `subst_eq_aeval_trunc_of_coeff_eq_zero`, `subst_mk_eq_aeval_trunc_of_tail_zero`), and the §5.9
  `degreeX P ≤ 1` / linear-in-`Z` reading is then a statement about that polynomial
  (`natDegree_trunc_mk_lt`).

All lemmas here are over an arbitrary base where substitution is legal: the substituted series `g`
satisfies `g.constantCoeff = 0` (equivalently `HasSubst g`, equivalently positive order), which is
exactly the BCIKS20 hypothesis on the shift series.  The substitution lemmas are stated for
`PowerSeries.subst` of a *univariate* target (`g : S⟦X⟧`), which is the form `γ` actually uses.
