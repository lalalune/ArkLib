# Polynomial equality from agreement on enough evaluation points

Identity lemmas for polynomials over a field: two polynomials whose degree is bounded and that
agree on sufficiently many points are equal.

* `eq_of_eval_eq_degree`: if `p.degree < n`, `q.degree < n`, and `p` and `q` agree on a finite
  set `s` with `n ≤ s.card`, then `p = q`.
* `eq_of_eval_eq_natDegree`: the `natDegree` variant of the same statement.

Let $p, q \in \mathbb{F}[X]$ be polynomials whose degrees are strictly bounded by $n$.
If $p$ and $q$ agree on a subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{F}$ with cardinality at least $n$,
then they are identical.

**Proof intuition**: The difference polynomial $r = p - q$ has degree less than $n$. If $r \neq 0$, it can have at
most $\deg(r) < n$ roots. However, $r$ vanishes on all elements of $S$, which has size at least $n$,
contradicting the degree bound. Thus, $r = 0$, implying $p = q$.

A variant of `eq_of_eval_eq_degree` using the natural degree `natDegree` instead of `degree`.
If two polynomials $p, q \in \mathbb{F}[X]$ have natural degree strictly less than $n$,
and they agree on a subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{F}$ of size at least $n$, then $p = q$.
