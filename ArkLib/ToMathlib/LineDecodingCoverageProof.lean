# LineDecoding: repair the refuted black-box ABF26 T4.21 statement (issue #140)

The previous `mcaForallDoubleCover_holds`, backed by the unsound `axiom mcaForallDoubleCover_residual`
(which asserted `MCAForallDoubleCover` for *all* codes/radii), has been removed: that universal claim
is genuinely FALSE. The honest result — a `ZMod 2` counterexample — is
`ProximityGap.mcaForallDoubleCover_not_universal` in
`ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/MCAForallDoubleCoverRefutation.lean`, re-exported here. The
per-instance double cover remains a genuine hypothesis supplied by the GS interpolation route.
