# Discharging the closed square-root boundary `hBoundary` residual

This file analyses and discharges the `hBoundary` residual of
`ArkLib/ToMathlib/CorrelatedAgreementListDecodingClosed.lean`, namely the boundary case
`¬(δ < 1 − √ρ)`.  Under the keystone's ambient hypothesis `δ ≤ 1 − √ρ` this case is *exactly*
the closed equality `δ = 1 − √ρ` (`ProximityGap.eq_sqrt_boundary_of_le_sqrt_and_not_lt`,
`Curves.lean:1398`), the Johnson radius of the Reed–Solomon code.

## What the in-tree machinery provides at the boundary, and what is missing

At the boundary `δ = 1 − √ρ` the error parameter degenerates to `errorBound = 0`
(`ProximityGap.errorBound_eq_zero_of_johnson_not_lt_sqrt`, `Curves.lean:1379`), so the front-door
probability hypothesis `Pr[curve δ-close] > k · errorBound = k · 0 = 0` collapses to *strict
positivity*.  Positivity yields only
`0 < (RS_goodCoeffsCurve …).card`
(`ProximityGap.goodCoeffsCurve_card_pos_of_prob_gt_johnson_boundary`,
`Curves.lean:1410`).  We restate this as `boundary_card_only_pos` to make the gap explicit.

The `jointAgreement` assembly bridge
`ProximityGap.goodCoeffsCurve_coeff_polys_implies_jointAgreement_of_pos_core` (`Curves.lean:975`)
requires *three* inputs:

* `card > k`,
* `card ≥ (|ι| + 1) · k`,  and
* the §5 coefficient-polynomial extraction `hcoeffPoly`.

In the **strict** branch all three are supplied: the two cardinality bounds come from the
*quantitative* threshold `Pr[…] > k · errorBound` with `errorBound > 0`
(`ProximityGap.goodCoeffsCurve_card_bounds_of_prob_threshold`), and the extraction from the §5
chain.  At the **boundary** `errorBound = 0` kills the quantitative threshold, so neither
cardinality
bound nor the extraction is delivered by `hprob` alone.  This is precisely why the boundary
`hBoundary`
stays a residual: it needs the *same* §5 input as the strict branch *plus* the cardinality lower
bound, which `hprob` cannot give once `errorBound = 0`.

## Disposition of the three candidate routes (from the task brief)

* **(i) "card > 0 + assembly".**  FALSE as stated for the front-door hypotheses alone: the assembly
  bridge consumes `card ≥ (|ι| + 1) · k`, not `card > 0`, and the §5 extraction.
  `boundary_card_only_pos`
  proves the front door gives exactly `card > 0` and no more.
* **(ii) "the boundary is vacuous under `hprob`/`hJ`".**  FALSE in general.  At `δ = 1 − √ρ` the
  Johnson hypothesis `hJ : (1 − ρ)/2 < δ` reduces to `(1 − √ρ)² > 0`, i.e. `√ρ ≠ 1`, which holds for
  every non-full code (`ρ < 1`).  `boundary_param_consistent_iff` makes this exact: the boundary
  case
  is reachable (non-contradictory) precisely when `√ρ ≠ 1`, so it cannot be discharged by vacuity.
* **(iii) "ε-monotonicity / limiting from the strict case".**  Does not close the kernel obligation:
  there is no in-tree limiting principle transporting `jointAgreement` from `δ' < 1 − √ρ` to the
  closed point, and `jointAgreement` at `δ = 1 − √ρ` is a *weaker* (larger-radius) statement than at
  `δ' < δ`, so monotonicity points the wrong way.

## What is therefore TRUE and proved here

The honest, kernel-clean result is the **reduction**
`boundary_jointAgreement_of_cards_and_coeffPolys`:
at the boundary, `jointAgreement` follows from the smallest explicit residual that is *not* the goal
—
the two good-set cardinality lower bounds and the §5 coefficient-polynomial extraction — by the
in-tree assembly bridge.  Packaged into the exact `hBoundary` shape consumed by the keystone, this
is
`hBoundary_of_boundary_cards_and_coeffPolys`.  The boundary residual is thereby reduced to *exactly*
the strict-branch inputs (cardinality + §5 extraction), discharging it modulo that explicit datum.

`#print axioms` rests only on `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

At `δ = 1 − √ρ`, the Johnson hypothesis `hJ : (1 − ρ)/2 < δ` is equivalent to `√ρ ≠ 1`, i.e. the
code is not full (`ρ < 1`).  Hence the boundary case is genuinely reachable and cannot be discharged
by showing it is vacuous. -/

/-! ## The deliverable: boundary `jointAgreement` from the smallest explicit residual

The honest residual at the boundary is *exactly* the strict-branch input that `hprob` no longer
supplies once `errorBound = 0`: the two good-set cardinality lower bounds and the §5 coefficient-
polynomial extraction.  Given those, the in-tree assembly bridge produces `jointAgreement`.  None of
these inputs is the goal `jointAgreement`. -/
