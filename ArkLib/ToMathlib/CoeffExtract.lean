# Coefficient Extraction for Power Series Solutions

This module formalizes the coefficient extraction step (corresponding to the `coeffExtract` field
of `BetaMatchingVanishes.MatchingPoint` / brick L12). Specifically, it relates the equality of two
power series (e.g., arising from Hensel uniqueness) to the vanishing of specific algebraic terms
in the recurrence.

## Mathematical Context

Let $F$ be a field, and let $H \in F[X][Y]$ be an irreducible polynomial defining an algebraic curve.
In the Hensel lifting context, uniqueness properties establish the equality of two power series
$$a_\beta = a_P$$
under a specialization map $\pi_z$.

By extracting the $t$-th coefficient of these power series, we thread the relation:
$$\alpha_t = \frac{\text{betaRec}(t)}{W^{t+1} \cdot \xi^{e_t}}$$
where $W$ and $\xi$ are non-zero elements. Extracting the coefficient at $(X - x_0)^t$ translates
the power-series level identity into a scalar-level vanishing condition:
$$\pi_z(\text{betaRec}(t)) = 0$$

## Key Formalizations
* `coeff_extract_scalar`: Distills the coefficient extraction process to bare field arithmetic.
* `coeff_extract_betaRec`: Connects the algebraic relation of $\alpha_t$ with the specialized power series,
  yielding the vanishing of the recurrence term.
* `MatchingPoint.mk_coeffExtract`: A constructor wrapper for matching point verification in the
  proximity gap argument.
