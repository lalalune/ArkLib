# `IsSquare` reflection through an injective `Nat.cast`

Mathlib provides `IsSquare.map` (pushing a square forward along a monoid hom) but no lemma pulling
`IsSquare` *back* through an injective `Nat.cast` given a cast-witnessed square root. This is the
reusable arithmetic step behind the BCIKS20 perfect-square Johnson-boundary characterization
(`BoundaryCardResidual.lean`, issue #64): once the real identity `(sqrtRate · |ι|)^2 = deg · |ι|`
is in hand over `ℝ≥0`, this lemma concludes `IsSquare (deg · |ι|)` in `ℕ`.
