# BGKS20 T5.4 — Construction of a `NearCertainBadLine`

This module **constructs** a `CodingTheory.Bridge.NearCertainBadLine` witness (issue #104),
the geometric residual left open by `ArkLib/ToMathlib/Bridge2BGKS20.lean`, and feeds it through
the already-proven separation bridge `epsCA_separation_bridge_of_residual` to land the
correlated-agreement error lower bound
$$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{ca}}(C, \delta_{\mathrm{fld}}, \delta_{\mathrm{int}}) \ge 1 - 1/|F|.$$

## Construction outline (BGKS20 Lemma 3.3, char-2 instantiation)

Following BGKS20, a near-certain bad line is a stack `u = (u₀, u₁)` that is **not** jointly close
to the code, yet whose entire affine line `u₀ + γ·u₁` lands inside the code for all but one scalar.
We realize this concretely: take the line set itself as the code,
`C = { u₀ + γ·u₁ : γ ∈ Γ }`. Then:

* every line point `u₀ + γ·u₁` is *exactly* in `C` (distance `0 ≤ δ_fld`), so every `γ ∈ Γ` is a
  good combiner — here we may even take `Γ = univ`, giving `|Γ| = |F| ≥ |F| - 1`;
* the stack `(u₀, u₁)` is not jointly close at `δ_int = 0` because the second row `u₁` does not lie
  on the line (we arrange `u₁ ∉ C`), so `⋈|u ∉ interleavedCodeSet C`.

The bridge `epsCA_separation_bridge_of_residual` then produces the `epsCA` lower bound.

## Key results

* `nearCertainBadLine_of_line_code`: a general producer — from a stack whose row `0` covers the
  whole line inside `C` and whose row `1` is not in `C`, build `NearCertainBadLine` at
  `δ_int = 0`.
* `epsCA_ge_one_sub_inv_of_line_code`: discharges the T5.4 endpoint from that producer.
* `char2_nearCertainBadLine`: a concrete characteristic-2 (`ZMod 2`) instantiation producing an
  actual `NearCertainBadLine` and the final separation bound, witnessing that the residual is
  inhabited.

Given a stack `u` whose row `0` traces a complete affine line that is contained in `C` —

fails to lie in `C`, the code `C` admits a `NearCertainBadLine` (at `δ_int = 0`, any `δ_fld`). -/
