# Support Preservation under Oracle Reduction and Context Lifting

This module establishes the core algebraic and support-level transport lemmas required for
the sequential composition and context lifting of oracle reductions, specifically supporting
`OracleReduction/Composition/Sequential/Append.lean` and
`OracleReduction/LiftContext/Reduction.lean`.

By isolating the support-transport reasoning from the larger security reductions, we maintain
modularity and avoid re-deriving the invariance of monadic supports under spec extensions.

/-- The monadic lifting operation `liftComp` preserves the support of a computation.
Specifically, for any oracle spec extension `superSpec` that embeds `oSpec`, the set of reachable
outcomes of `liftComp mx superSpec` is identical to the support of the original computation `mx`.
This constitutes the support-level projection of the distributional identity `evalDist_liftComp`. -/

variable {StmtIn WitIn StmtOut WitOut : Type} {n : ℕ} {pSpec : ProtocolSpec n}

/-- Verifier reachability under reduction runs.
Let `reduction` be a reduction protocol. For any statement-witness pair in the support of the
full reduction execution `reduction.run stmt wit`, the verifier's final output statement is a
reachable outcome of the verifier's execution when run on the statement and the transcript.

This provides the transcript witness for `Verifier.compatStatement`: the witness transcript is
the `proverResult.1` component of the run result. The verifier sub-computation is lifted as
`liftM (verifier.run stmt td).run`; because `OracleComp.liftComp` preserves supports, the
reachability
relation transports back to the un-lifted execution. -/
