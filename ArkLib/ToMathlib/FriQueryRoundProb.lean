# FRI query-round soundness: probability-measure form (issue #14)

The Batched FRI security file (`ArkLib/ProofSystem/BatchedFri/Security.lean`) proves the
**counting** form of the query-round acceptance bound:

  `|{ q : Fin t → ι | ∀ j, q j ∈ G }| / N ^ t ≤ (1 - δ) ^ t`,

where `G` is the "good" (corruption-missing) set of evaluation points, `N = |ι|` is the domain
size, and `t` is the number of independent query repetitions.

That counting ratio is exactly the **probability**, under `t` *independent uniform* queries, that
every query lands in `G` — i.e. the probability that a `δ`-far word slips through the entire
query phase undetected. This module makes that bridge precise and self-contained (it imports only
`Mathlib`, so it is verifiable independently of the FRI dependency cone, which is currently not
fully built in the shared checkout).

## Main results

* `prob_allQueriesIn_eq` : under the independent-uniform product PMF on `Fin t → ι`, the
  probability of the event `{ q | ∀ j, q j ∈ G }` equals `(|G| / N) ^ t`.
* `prob_allQueriesIn_le` : that probability is `≤ (1 - δ) ^ t` whenever the good set has
  density `|G| / N ≤ 1 - δ` (the soundness-error bound consumed by Claim 8.2).
* `prob_someQueryOut_ge` : the complementary detection probability is
  `≥ 1 - (1 - δ) ^ t` — the honest "the verifier catches a far word" statement.

All results are `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` only.

/-! ### Query-round detection amplification (issue #14)

The detection lower bound `1 - (1 - δ) ^ t` from `prob_someQueryOut_ge` is monotone in the number
of queries `t` and, for `t ≥ 1`, dominates the single-query rejection probability `δ`. These
arithmetic facts turn a single-query rejection guarantee — in particular the BCIKS20 RS
affine-line proximity threshold `ε := errorBound δ deg domain`, which lower-bounds the
single-query detection of a `δ`-far word — into a `t`-round rejection guarantee. -/

/-- `(1 - δ) ^ t` is antitone in `t`, since `1 - δ ≤ 1`: more queries can only shrink the
joint-acceptance probability of a far word. -/
def accProb_antitone (δ : ℝ≥0∞) {t₁ t₂ : ℕ} (h : t₁ ≤ t₂) : Prop :=
    (1 - δ) ^ t₂ ≤ (1 - δ) ^ t₁

/-- The per-round detection lower bound `1 - (1 - δ) ^ t` is monotone in the number of queries
`t`: more queries can only increase the rejection guarantee. -/
def detectBound_monotone (δ : ℝ≥0∞) {t₁ t₂ : ℕ} (h : t₁ ≤ t₂) : Prop :=
    (1 : ℝ≥0∞) - (1 - δ) ^ t₁ ≤ 1 - (1 - δ) ^ t₂

/-- With a single query the detection lower bound is exactly `δ`: a `δ`-far word is rejected with
probability `≥ 1 - (1 - δ) ^ 1 = δ`. -/
def detectBound_one (δ : ℝ≥0∞) (hδ : δ ≤ 1) : Prop :=
    (1 : ℝ≥0∞) - (1 - δ) ^ 1 = δ

/-- For at least one query, the `t`-round detection lower bound dominates the single-query
rejection probability `δ`. -/
def detectBound_ge_delta (δ : ℝ≥0∞) (hδ : δ ≤ 1) {t : ℕ} (ht : 1 ≤ t) : Prop :=
    δ ≤ (1 : ℝ≥0∞) - (1 - δ) ^ t

/-- **A query round rejects a far word with probability ≥ the proximity bound.** If a proximity
error threshold `ε` (e.g. the BCIKS20 RS affine-line `errorBound δ deg domain`) lower-bounds the
single-query rejection probability `δ` of a `δ`-far word, then the `t`-query round (`t ≥ 1`)
rejects that word — `some query lands outside the good set` — with probability at least `ε`.

This is the arithmetic bridge from the single-round RS affine-line proximity rejection to the
amplified `t`-round query phase: increasing the query count never decreases the guarantee. -/
