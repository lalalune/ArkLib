# Functoriality of the Newton iteration (#304, the section-Newton transport unifier)

The series-coefficient Newton iteration of `HenselSeriesCoeff` (`S`, `γ`) commutes with any
ring homomorphism `φ : R →+* R'` mapping the data, **provided the source derivative response
is a unit**: `PowerSeries.map φ (γ Q c) = γ (Q.map (PowerSeries.map φ)) (φ c)`
(`map_γ`, coefficient form `coeff_map_γ`).

This is THE transport unifier of the elementary section-Newton route: instantiated at the
localization `A := Localization.Away ξ̄` of `F[Z]` (where the derivative response ξ̄ **is** a
unit), the two maps

* `A →+* RatFunc F` (the global fraction embedding), and
* `A →+* F` (per-place evaluation at `z` with `ξ̄(z) ≠ 0`, via `Localization.awayLift`)

carry the SAME Newton iterate `γ_A` to the global `γ_K` (the object the engine and the
tail/window machinery consume) and to the per-place specialized iterate (the object per-place
Hensel uniqueness pins to the decoded Taylor series).  One lemma replaces both transport
chains of the legacy `𝒪/𝕃`-route (`LocalizationEmbedding` + `LocalizedPlaceEvaluation` +
`AssembledRootDescent`).

The unit hypothesis is genuinely needed on the source: the recursion divides by
`Ring.inverse` of the response, and `Ring.inverse` commutes with `φ` **only at units**
(`φ` can create units — e.g. `eval z : F[Z] → F` makes `ξ̄` invertible at `ξ̄(z) ≠ 0` —
and on a non-unit source `Ring.inverse = 0` while the target inverse is genuine).
