# Distinct-irreducible-factor count over a field

For a polynomial `p : K[X]` over a *field* `K`, the number of DISTINCT irreducible factors of `p`
is at most `p.natDegree`.

Unlike the in-tree `F[Z][X]` count
`pg_card_normalizedFactors_toFinset_le_natDegree` (in `BCIKS20.ListDecoding.Extraction`), which
needs `p.Separable` because the coefficient ring `F[Z]` is *not* a field and admits constant-in-`X`
irreducible factors of `X`-degree `0`, the field-base statement needs **no separability
hypothesis**: every irreducible factor of a polynomial over a field is non-constant
(`Irreducible.natDegree_pos`), so the number of distinct factors is bounded by the total degree.

This is the function-field analogue (`K = F(Z)`) of the list-size degree bound used in
Guruswami–Sudan extraction: the distinct irreducible factors of the interpolant over `K` index the
candidate messages, and their number is `≤ deg_Y` of the interpolant. It supplies the shape of the
`hYbound : Index.card ≤ ℓ` field of `Hab25JohnsonAlgebraicData` (issue #68) for any GS factorisation
carried out over a field rather than over `F[Z]`.

/-- Degree-budget corollary of `card_normalizedFactors_toFinset_le_natDegree`.

If an external construction bounds `p.natDegree` by `ell`, then the number of distinct
normalized irreducible factors is bounded by the same `ell`. This is the direct `hYbound`
shape used by Hab25 algebraic-data packages. -/
