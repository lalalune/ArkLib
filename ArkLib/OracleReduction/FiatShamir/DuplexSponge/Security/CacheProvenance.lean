# Cache provenance for the Lemma 5.8 dedup reduction (issue #316)

The one remaining Lemma-5.8 obligation (`EPaperReduction`,
`Lemma58Correspondence.lean`) is pure list combinatorics: on a consistent log, `EPaper`
forces an anchored collision.  Its extraction argument consumes four cache-fold facts,
proven here:

* **Provenance** (`cacheFold_hash_mem` / `cacheFold_pair_mem`): every record of the folded
  cache comes from a log entry — a cached hash answer from a hash entry, a cached
  permutation pair from a forward entry or its inverse mirror.
* **Persistence** (`stepCache_hash_mono` / `stepCache_pair_mono` + the fold closures):
  `stepCache` never deletes; records survive to every later fold point.
* **Fresh-caching** (`stepCache_caches_fresh_*`): a fresh entry (cache lookup misses)
  creates its record.
* **Slot transport** (`mem_slotList_of_hash` / `mem_slotList_of_pair_fst` /
  `mem_slotList_of_pair_snd`): cached records put their capacities in `slotList` — both
  components for permutation pairs (so query-side capacities of cached permutation entries
  ARE slots; only hash query sides are excluded, matching CO25 Eqs. 25/26's disjuncts).

With these, the extraction plan for `EPaperReduction` is mechanical (posted on #316): pull
the two coinciding dedup entries back to their raw class-first slots (order-preserving,
`dedup_pair_of_firstOfClassAt` machinery); the earlier one is fresh at its slot and caches
(fresh-caching), persists (persistence), lands its capacities in `slotList` (transport);
the later one is fresh at its slot (consistency + first-of-class) and its sampled answer
capacity hits the earlier slot or its own query capacity — exactly `collisionStep`, hence
`AnchoredFrom`.
