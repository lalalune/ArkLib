  # Trees of transcripts

  This file defines the *tree of transcripts* abstraction that underlies tree-based knowledge
  extraction notions such as (coordinate-wise) special soundness.

  A tree of transcripts for a `pSpec : ProtocolSpec n` is a tree that branches **only at challenge
  rounds**. Concretely:

  - at a *message round* the prover sends a single message, so the corresponding node has exactly
    one child;
  - at a *challenge round* the node has `arity i` children, each labelled by the challenge value
    that the verifier sent on that branch.

  Reading the labels along any root-to-leaf path yields a `FullTranscript pSpec`. Two paths that
  agree on all challenges up to some round automatically share the same prover messages up to that
  round — this is exactly the "common prefix" guarantee that rewinding (forking) the prover
  provides, and the reason the tree shape is the natural object produced by a forking extractor.

  This abstraction is deliberately agnostic to *what* combinatorial relation the sibling challenges
  satisfy. Plain `k`-special soundness requires the siblings to be pairwise distinct;
  coordinate-wise special soundness requires them to form a coordinate-wise structured set. Both
  notions therefore reuse the `ChallengeTree` defined here, instantiating only the branching arity
  and the predicate on sibling challenges (see `CoordinateWiseSpecialSoundness.lean`).

variable {n : ℕ}

/-- A **tree of transcripts** for a protocol `pSpec`, branching only at challenge rounds.

The tree is indexed by the current round `m : Fin (n + 1)` (the rounds `m, m+1, …, n-1` are still to
come). Each challenge round `i` branches into `arity i` children. A `ChallengeTree pSpec arity 0`
(rooted at round `0`) describes a full tree of transcripts; reading the messages and challenges
along each root-to-leaf path recovers the corresponding `FullTranscript pSpec` (see
`ChallengeTree.transcripts`).

The challenge labels and subtrees of a challenge node are kept as two separate functions (rather
than a single function into a product) so that the recursive occurrence is not nested under `Prod`,
which the kernel forbids.

Note: The challenge arity is determined by the round index, not the path. So path-dependent
branching (e.g. "branch into 2 if the first challenge is `0`, branch into 3 if it's `1`") is not
currently supported. This may be generalized in the future, but keeps the current design simple
enough to follow the CWSS paper proofs.
