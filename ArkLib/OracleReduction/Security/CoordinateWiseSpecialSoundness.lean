  # Coordinate-Wise Special Soundness (CWSS)

  This file defines **coordinate-wise special soundness** for (oracle) reductions, following
  [FMN24] (*Lattice-Based Polynomial Commitments*, who introduce the notion) and [NOZ26] (*Hachi*,
  Definition 3, which is the multi-round form we target for verification).

  ## The idea

  Coordinate-wise special soundness generalizes `k`-special soundness. In `k`-special soundness one
  extracts a witness from a tree of accepting transcripts in which, at each challenge round, there
  are `k` children with pairwise distinct challenges. In coordinate-wise special soundness the
  challenge of round `i` is a *vector* `Sᵢ^{ℓᵢ}`, and the children challenges form a structured set
  `SS(Sᵢ, ℓᵢ, kᵢ)`: there is a "central" challenge vector together with, for every coordinate,
  `kᵢ-1` sibling vectors that differ from the central one *only in that coordinate*. The arity at
  round `i` is therefore `ℓᵢ·(kᵢ-1)+1`.

  Plain `kᵢ`-special soundness is recovered as the special case `ℓᵢ = 1` (see
  `CWSSStructure.ofSpecialSound`), so this development is shared with special soundness via the
  common `ProtocolSpec.ChallengeTree` (defined in `TranscriptTree.lean`).

  ## What is defined here

  1. The combinatorics of `SS(S, ℓ, k)`: `CoordEq` (the relation `≡ᵢ`) and `IsSpecialSoundFamily`.
  2. A `CWSSStructure`, packaging the per-round coordinate decomposition `Challenge i ≃ Sᵢ^{ℓᵢ}` and
     soundness parameters `kᵢ`.
  3. `ChallengeTree.IsStructured`: the predicate that a tree's sibling challenges form `SS`-sets.
  4. `Verifier.coordinateWiseSpecialSound`: existence of a (deterministic) extractor that turns any
     structured, accepting tree of transcripts into a valid input witness — exactly [NOZ26] Def. 3.
  5. The connection to knowledge soundness via **rewinding**: CWSS implies knowledge soundness with
     error `∑ᵢ ℓᵢ·kᵢ / |Sᵢ|^{ℓᵢ}` ([NOZ26] Lemma 4 / [FMN24] §7–8). The knowledge extractor is
     *not* straightline: it grows the tree of transcripts by repeatedly **forking** the prover at
     each challenge round, using `VCVio.CryptoFoundations.forkReplay`, and then applies the
     combinatorial extractor above. This is the role rewinding plays in CWSS.

/-! ## The combinatorial structure `SS(S, ℓ, k)`

These definitions are pure combinatorics on vectors in `S^ℓ ≃ (Fin ℓ → S)`, independent of any
protocol. They capture exactly the set `SS(S, ℓ, k)` from [FMN24] / [NOZ26].
-/

variable {S : Type*}

/-- The relation `x ≡ᵢ y`: the coordinate-vectors `x` and `y` agree in every coordinate except the
  `i`-th, where they differ. For `ℓ = 1` this is just `x 0 ≠ y 0`. -/
def CoordEq {ℓ : ℕ} (i : Fin ℓ) (x y : Fin ℓ → S) : Prop :=
  x i ≠ y i ∧ ∀ j, j ≠ i → x j = y j

/-- A family of `ℓ·(k-1)+1` coordinate-vectors `c` is **coordinate-wise special sound**, i.e. lies
  in `SS(S, ℓ, k)`, if

  - the `ℓ·(k-1)+1` vectors are pairwise distinct (`Function.Injective c`), and
  - there is a *central* index `e` such that for every coordinate `i ∈ Fin ℓ` there are `k-1` other
    indices whose vectors agree with `c e` off coordinate `i` (and differ on it).

  This is the precise rendering of the set `SS(S, ℓ, k)` from [FMN24] Def. 2.9 / [NOZ26] §2.3.
  In the paper `SS(S, ℓ, k)` is a *set* `{x₁, …, x_K}` of `K := ℓ·(k-1)+1` **distinct** vectors; the
  `Function.Injective c` clause is what encodes that distinctness. It is load-bearing: since the
  `k-1` siblings of a coordinate `i` agree with `c e` off coordinate `i`, distinctness of the
  vectors forces them to be pairwise distinct *in coordinate `i`*, giving the `k` distinct values
  per coordinate that extraction relies on. (Without it, the siblings could collapse to a single
  value, leaving only `2` distinct values in a coordinate.) The branching arity `ℓ·(k-1)+1` is
  built into the index type. -/

/-- For `ℓ = 1`, coordinate-wise special soundness is ordinary `k`-special soundness: the challenge

/-! ## From CWSS to knowledge soundness, via rewinding

The combinatorial extractor above turns any *given* structured, accepting tree into a witness. To
turn this into knowledge soundness one must *produce* such a tree from a single (malicious) prover.
This is done by **rewinding**: run the prover once, then at each challenge round repeatedly fork it
— replaying the transcript up to that round and resampling that single challenge — to obtain the
`ℓᵢ·(kᵢ-1)+1` coordinate-wise-related siblings. The forking primitive is
`VCVio.CryptoFoundations.forkReplay`, which records a first run's query log and replays it up to a
distinguished challenge query while changing exactly that answer.

We record the resulting knowledge error and state the implication. The proof (future work) iterates
`forkReplay` over the challenge rounds to build a `ChallengeTree`, following [FMN24] §7–8 / [NOZ26]
Lemma 4 and the Fiat–Shamir analysis of [AFK22].

  -- The missing theorem is a multi-round replay/fork bridge, roughly:
  --
  --   `cwssForkReplayTreeKnowledgeSoundness`:
  --     from the `Extractor.TreeBased` supplied by `coordinateWiseSpecialSound`, construct a

  --     `ChallengeTree pSpec D.arity 0`, proves `tree.IsStructured D` and
  --     `tree.IsAccepting init impl verifier stmtIn relOut.language`, and bounds the bad event by
  --     `D.knowledgeError`.
  --
  -- API requirements for that theorem:
  -- * an interactive rewinding extractor/knowledge-soundness notion for `Verifier`, or a proven
  --   bridge from such a rewinding game to the existing straightline `knowledgeSoundness`;
  -- * a way to rerun `Reduction.mk prover verifier` from a saved prefix/query log at a selected
  --   challenge round and expose the fork point required by `forkReplay`;
  -- * support/log lemmas lifting `forkReplay_success_log_props` from one oracle query to full
  --   `FullTranscript` prefix equality and then to `ChallengeTree` construction;
  -- * a quantitative multi-fork bound whose per-round failure terms sum to
  --   `∑ i, (D.coordIndex i * D.soundnessParam i) /
  --     (Fintype.card (D.alphabet i) ^ D.coordIndex i)`;
  -- * finite/sampleable instances tying `pSpec.Challenge i` to the coordinate alphabet via
  --   `D.decompose`, since `forkReplay` samples from the challenge oracle range while
  --   `D.knowledgeError` is stated using `D.alphabet i`.
  -- Proof outline (future work): the straightline knowledge extractor is replaced by a rewinding
  -- one. Given black-box access to the prover, run it once to get an accepting leaf; then, at each
  -- challenge round, repeatedly invoke `VCVio.CryptoFoundations.forkReplay` on the challenge
  -- oracle to obtain the `ℓ·(k-1)+1` coordinate-wise-related siblings, assembling a `ChallengeTree`
  -- that is `IsStructured` and `IsAccepting`. Feeding this tree to the combinatorial extractor from
  -- the `coordinateWiseSpecialSound` hypothesis yields a witness in `relIn`; the forking-bound
  -- analysis ([FMN24] §7–8 / [NOZ26] Lemma 4) gives the error `D.knowledgeError`.
