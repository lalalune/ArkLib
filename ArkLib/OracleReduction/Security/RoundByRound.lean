/-- A **one-shot** round-by-round extractor is a function that:
- Takes in index `m : Fin (n + 1)`
- Takes in the input statement `stmtIn : StmtIn`
- Takes in a partial transcript up to round `m`
- Takes in the prover's query log (planned refinement: include the verifier's query log as well)

and returns an input witness `witIn : WitIn`.

This is the old definition of round-by-round extractor, which is less general than the new
definition (i.e. the input witness is extracted immediately, "in one shot", unlike the general
definition where the input witness is derived via intermediate witnesses). -/

-- The previous body was an explicit "Placeholder condition for now" stated over query-log extension
-- (`proveQueryLog₁.Sublist proveQueryLog₂`). That condition is *inert*: it is exactly what
-- `toKnowledgeStateFunction` below needs, but only after we identify the *transcript-prefix*
-- (round) direction along which monotonicity must hold. We derive the real content directly from
-- where the conversion fails (the round-`m+1 → m` step of `KnowledgeStateFunction.toFun_next`): the
-- one-shot extractor, run at round `m.succ` on a transcript `tr.concat msg`, when it lands inside
-- `relIn`, must also land inside `relIn` when run at the prefix round `m.castSucc` on `tr`. This is
-- the precise (and only) ingredient the converter is missing — see
-- `toKnowledgeStateFunction` and docs/kb/audits/gh-issues-campaign-2026-06-04.md (Blocker-C).
/-- A one-shot round-by-round extractor is **monotone** (with respect to an input relation `relIn`)
  if, whenever the extracted input witness at round `m.succ` on a transcript `tr.concat msg` is valid
  for `relIn`, then the extracted input witness at the prefix round `m.castSucc` on `tr` is also
  valid for `relIn`.

  This is the round-by-round (transcript-prefix) monotonicity that the conversion
  `KnowledgeStateFunctionOneShot.toKnowledgeStateFunction` requires: the general round-by-round
  knowledge state function processes rounds in decreasing order `n → 0`, extracting the input
  witness from each round's transcript, and its `toFun_next` obligation is exactly that validity at
  round `m.succ` descends to validity at round `m.castSucc`. -/

/-- A **round-by-round extractor** is a tuple of algorithms that iteratively extracts the input
  witness from the output witness, through a series of intermediate witnesses
  (indexed by `m : Fin (n + 1)`). Formally, it contains the following components:

  - A proof `eqIn : WitMid 0 = WitIn` that the first intermediate witness type is equal to the
    input witness type
  - A function `extractMid : (m : Fin n) → StmtIn → Transcript m.succ pSpec`

    from the intermediate witness for round `m+1`, using the transcript up to round `m+1` and
    the intermediate witness for round `m+1`
  - A function `extractOut : StmtIn → FullTranscript pSpec → WitOut → WitMid (.last n)` that
    constructs the intermediate witness for the final round from the output witness

  The extractor processes rounds in decreasing order: `n → n-1 → ... → 1 → 0`, using
  intermediate witness types `WitMid m` for each round `m`.

/-! ### Reusable combinatorial / union-bound backbone for round-by-round soundness

These lemmas isolate the two protocol-independent ingredients of the
`rbrSoundness → soundness` implication (and its knowledge variant):

* a *first-crossing* (pigeonhole) argument: a Prop-valued sequence over the `Fin (n + 1)` rounds
  that is `false` at round `0` and `true` at the last round must *flip* `false → true` at some
  round, and — given the `toFun_next` semantics that forbid flips at prover-to-verifier rounds —
  that flipping round is a *challenge* round; and
* a *finite union bound* over the (finite) set of challenge rounds.

Composing these reduces the soundness error to `∑ i, rbrSoundnessError i`, once the realized run is
related to the per-round partial-run marginals.  The two lemmas below are fully general (they make
no reference to the probabilistic execution), so they are directly reusable for both the plain and
the knowledge variants. -/

/-- **First-crossing / pigeonhole over rounds.**  If a `Prop`-valued sequence indexed by the
`Fin (n + 1)` rounds is `false` at round `0` and `true` at the last round, then there is some round
`j : Fin n` at which it flips from `false` (at `j.castSucc`) to `true` (at `j.succ`).

This is the protocol-independent core of the union bound that turns round-by-round soundness into
plain soundness: a run that ends accepting on a bad statement (state `true` at the end) but starts
rejecting (state `false` at the start) must cross at some first round, and the per-round crossing
events are exactly what `rbrSoundnessError` bounds. -/

This is the reusable probabilistic core of the `rbrSoundness → soundness` marginal bridge: the full
prover run threads the trailing `receiveChallenge`/`sendMessage`/`output` and verifier steps, which
the round-by-round game omits; since the per-round flip event depends only on the transcript prefix
(already determined before those steps), dropping them can only raise the event probability —
turning the marginal relation into the `≤` direction needed to chain to `rbrSoundnessError`. -/

is the characterization the `rbrSoundness → soundness` per-round bound consumes: the soundness game's

For an *arbitrary* stateful query implementation `so : QueryImpl spec (StateT σ ProbComp)` and start
state `s`, running `simulateQ so` on a computation that, after producing `a`, executes a trailing
(possibly-failing) `gb a` and then returns `h a`, has event probability at most that of the
computation that skips the trailing step.  The trailing `gb a` threads the simulation state and can
only add failure mass, which only lowers the event probability.

This is the missing connective of the `rbrSoundness → soundness` marginal bridge: it lets the
trailing `receiveChallenge`/`sendMessage`/`output`/verifier steps of the full run be dropped (one
`probEvent ≤` at a time) while keeping the same arbitrary `impl`/state thread that both the soundness

/-- **Failure-monotone trailing `Option.elimM` drop, transported across `simulateQ … |>.run'`.**
A specialization of the trailing-bind transport to the `OptionT`/`Option.elimM` shape of
`Reduction.run`: after producing `some a` from `ma`, the soundness game runs a trailing
(possibly-failing, possibly-`none`-returning) `Option.elimM`-continuation whose result is the final
output, but the flip event reads only `h a` (a function of the *prefix* `a`).  Replacing the entire
continuation by `pure (some (h a))` (always success) can only *raise* the event probability of an
event that is `False` on `none`: every failure / `none` outcome of the continuation makes the event
`False`, so dropping it only adds success mass.  This is the `Option`-level analogue of
`probEvent_simulateQ_run'_bind_trailing_le`, used to peel the verifier/`getM`/later-round tail off
the soundness game while keeping the shared `impl`/state thread. -/
