# The Trace Map `Tr_H`

For a subgroup `H` of Galois automorphisms, the relative trace is `Tr_H(a) := Σ_{σ ∈ H} σ(a)`.
Hachi [NOZ26, §3] uses `Tr_H` (for `H = ⟨σ_{-1}, σ_{4k+1}⟩`) to express inner products over the
subfield `F_{q^k} ≅ R_q^H` as relations over `R_q` (Theorem 2).

Computably, the trace is the finite sum of the automorphism actions over the exponent set `Hexp`.
It is additive (proven here, from additivity of `galoisAut`). That its image lands in the fixed
subring `R_q^H` and that `Tr_H` restricted there is `(d/k)·id` on the diagonal (Theorem 2) are
deferred.

## Main definitions

* `traceOver Φ S` — `Σ_{i ∈ S} σ_i`, the trace over an arbitrary exponent set.
* `traceH α k` — the trace `Tr_H` over `H = ⟨σ_{-1}, σ_{4k+1}⟩`.

/-- The **trace over an exponent set** `S`: `Σ_{i ∈ S} σ_i(a)`.

Noncomputable as stated, since `Finset.sum` routes through `Rq`'s (transported, noncomputable)
`CommRing`. The computable counterpart is `traceOverComp` (equal by `traceOverComp_eq`); the
underlying automorphism action `galoisAut` is itself computable. -/
