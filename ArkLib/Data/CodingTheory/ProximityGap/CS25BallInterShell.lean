# Distance-dependent shell bound for the ball-intersection count (toward T4.17, #82)

The CS25 breakdown's far/coverage half needs a `ballInterCount(r, v)` bound that *decreases* with the
pair distance `wt(v)` — the in-tree bounds being only the vanishing `wt(v) > 2r ⇒ 0`
(`ballInterCount_eq_zero_of_lt`) and the loose `≤ V` (`ballInterCount_le`), which make the second
moment as loose as the first moment.

This file proves the first genuinely distance-dependent bound: the two-ball intersection lies inside
a **shell**. Any `x ∈ B(0,r) ∩ B(v,r)` has `dist(x,0) ≥ wt(v) − r` (triangle inequality:
`wt(v) = dist(0,v) ≤ dist(0,x) + dist(x,v) ≤ dist(x,0) + r`), so

  `ballInterCount(r, v) ≤ #{x : dist(x,0) ≤ r ∧ wt(v) ≤ dist(x,0) + r}`,

i.e. the intersection is confined to the Hamming shell `wt(v) − r ≤ dist(x,0) ≤ r`. As `wt(v)`
grows toward `2r` the inner radius `wt(v) − r` rises to `r`, thinning the shell to a sphere — the
distance dependence the tight second-moment estimate (and CS25's `√`-deviation term) requires.
