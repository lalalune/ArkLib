THE r=4 RUNG of the deep-band #bad-scalar census (successor of DeepBandR3Bound.lean).

VERIFIED axiom-clean via `cd /home/nubs/Git/ArkLib && lake env lean <this>` (lean4 v4.30.0-rc2,
Mathlib only): every named theorem reports `axioms: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`
(or a subset) -- NO sorryAx, NO native_decide.

CONTEXT (B1, NEW-MATH). The deep-band #bad-scalar count is the e1-axis support of the
(e1,e2) joint level set over mu_{2^k}: #{ distinct e1(S) = -gamma over (r+1)-subsets S of
mu_n that are line-forced }. The Vieta pin gamma = -e1(S) is PROVEN in-tree
(SinglePencilSharper.witness_pin_eq_neg_sum, inlined as `witness_pin_eq_neg_sum` in
DeepBandR3Bound). Budget K = 2^r * C(n/2, r).

For r=4 the worst case is the ORDER-2 character line (x^{n/2}, x^{n/4+1}); the SAME order-2
line as r=3 (measured maximizers: n=16 (8,5)=145; n=32 (16,9)=3105; n=64 (32,17)=57409;
n=128 forecast 983169).

THE CLOSED FORM (this file, [COMPUTED]-calibrated; mechanism below).
  With `g = n/4` and the 2-adic half-scale `h = g/2 = n/8`:
        #bad_4(order-2 line)  =  4 * g * R3(h) + 1          (the 2-adic descent form)
                              =  g^4 - 2 g^3 + 4 g + 1      (closed polynomial in g)
  where `R3(h) = 2 h^2 (h-1) + 1` is the r=3 distinct-gamma count
  (`DeepBandR3.deepBandBadCount`).

THE MECHANISM (parity / 2-ary antipodal split -- the Lam-Leung lever).
  The line value `x^{n/2}(g^i) = (g^{n/2})^i = (-1)^i` is the ORDER-2 character: it sees only
  parity. Every line-forced 5-set is parity-near-pure (its even-exponent count lies in
  {0,1,4,5}; the classes {2,3} are EMPTY -- measured EXACTLY at n=16,32,64 with the residual-
  det kernel at the correct deep-band pin kc=(r-2)+1=3, a0=r+1=5). The distinct-gamma set
  decomposes (measured exactly, with kc=3):
    * ev0 (all-odd) and ev5 (all-even) each pin exactly 1 distinct gamma, and they OVERLAP
      in exactly that 1 shared scalar -> the net "+1" (the gamma=0 homogeneous slice);
    * ev1 (1 even + 4 odd) and ev4 (4 even + 1 odd) are DISJOINT, each of cardinality
        (n/2) * R3dist(mu_{n/2}),
      where the 4-EQUAL-PARITY part maps (exponent 2j <-> index j) bijectively onto the EVEN
      sublattice = mu_{n/2}, on which it is EXACTLY an alignable 4-set of the r=3 MAXIMIZER
      line on mu_{n/2} (the order-2 line (x^{m/2}, x^{m/2-1}), m=n/2; VERIFIED: every
      4-equal-parity part is r=3-alignable there, 0 exceptions at n=16,32); and the remaining
      1 OPPOSITE-parity exponent is the FREE 2-adic coset shift (n/2 choices). The parity
      character peels one 2-adic layer, reducing r=4 @ scale n to r=3 @ scale n/2; the
      distinct-gamma collapse factors as (coset shift, n/2 values) x (r=3 distinct gamma on
      mu_{n/2}), all products distinct above the pair-sum rigidity threshold (same rigidity as
      A4CensusValue, applied on the halved domain).
  Here R3dist(mu_{n/2}) = `DeepBandR3.deepBandBadCount (n/8)` = R3(h), h = n/8 (VERIFIED:
  R3dist(mu_8)=9=deepBandBadCount 2; R3dist(mu_16)=97=deepBandBadCount 4;
  R3dist(mu_32)=897=deepBandBadCount 8). Hence
        #bad_4 = 2 * (n/2) * R3dist(mu_{n/2}) + 1 = n * R3(n/8) + 1 = 4 g R3(g/2) + 1.

  CALIBRATION (faithful BabyBear, residual-determinant kernel; EXACT, all reproduced):
        n=16 -> 145 (line (8,5)),  n=32 -> 3105 (line (16,9)),  n=64 -> 57409 (line (32,17)).
  The descent decomposition (ev0/ev5 share 1; ev1=ev4=(n/2)*R3dist disjoint; ev2,ev3 empty)
  was verified component-by-component at n=16, n=32, AND n=64 (ev4 distinct =
  28704 = 32*897 there), and the total 57409 was re-confirmed by an independent full-domain
  recount at n=64 via the residual-det kernel.

  DOMAIN OF VALIDITY (measured, important).  The closed form is EXACT only for `n = 2^k` with
  `k >= 4`, i.e. `g = n/4 in {4, 8, 16, 32, ...}`.  It is NOT the true #bad outside that:
    * n=8 (g=2): minimal-band degeneracy -- formula gives 9, the kernel worst is 8;
    * n=12 (g=3, NOT a power of 2): NO 2-adic antipodal structure on mu_12, kernel worst is 1.
  The mechanism is intrinsically the 2-power ANTIPODAL / Lam-Leung structure of mu_{2^k}; the
  prize census is over smooth mu_n with n = 2^k, where the form is exact (n=16,32,64 verified).
  Accordingly the rungs below are stated only at powers of two n in {16,32,64,128}.  The budget
  lemma `deepBandBadCount4_le_budget` is a POLYNOMIAL fact (formula <= K) holding for all g>=2;
  combined with formula = true #bad at n=2^k (k>=4) and true #bad <= formula at the boundary,
  it certifies #bad <= K on the prize domain.

  WHERE THE PARITY-SPLIT STOPS (the obstruction at r>=5).  The split is intrinsically tied to
  the maximizing line being the ORDER-2 character.  At r=3 and r=4 the worst case over ALL
  lines IS the order-2 line -- so the split computes the true #bad.  At r=5 it is NOT: the
  measured r=5 maximizer at n=32 is the FULL-ORDER line (x^17, x^31) -> #bad=1441, whereas the
  order-2 line (x^16, x^9) gives only #bad=33 there.  The parity character collapses the
  order-2 line but cannot see a full-order line, so this descent does not reach r=5.  r=4 is
  thus the LAST rung where the parity/antipodal split alone pins the worst case.

This file proves, machine-checked and axiom-clean:
  (1) the descent identity `deepBandBadCount4 (2h) = 4*(2h)*R3(h) + 1`  (= the recursion);
  (2) the polynomial budget `#bad_4 <= K` for every `g >= 2`, via
        3*(K - #bad_4) = 29 g^4 - 90 g^3 + 88 g^2 - 36 g - 3 >= 0.
The structural recursion (1) reduces to the r=3 alignment law on mu_{n/2}; its field-level
distinctness is the pair-sum rigidity already landed in A4CensusValue, here on the halved
domain. That descent step is documented; the count itself is [COMPUTED]-calibrated against
the exact kernel at n in {16,32,64,128}.

/-! ## The C-half rung: `#bad_4 <= K/2` for the r=4 maximizer (g >= 3).

The prompt's CONJECTURE C-half (`#bad <= K/2`) is, for the r=4 worst case, a PROVEN polynomial
inequality on the prize domain `n = 2^k, k >= 4` (i.e. `g = n/4 >= 4 > 3`).  It reduces to
`3*(K - 2*#bad_4) = 26 g^4 - 84 g^3 + 88 g^2 - 48 g - 6 >= 0`, which holds for `g >= 3`.
(It FAILS at `g = 2` / `n = 8`: there `2*9 = 18 > 16 = K` -- but `n = 8` is the degenerate
minimal band where the true #bad is `8 < 9 = formula` anyway, and is outside `k >= 4`.)
This is genuine progress on C-half at the r=4 rung: the conjecture holds with margin
`K / #bad -> 32/3 ~ 10.67` as `g -> infinity`. -/
