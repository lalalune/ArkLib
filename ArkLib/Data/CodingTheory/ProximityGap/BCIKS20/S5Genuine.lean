# BCIKS20 §5.2.6–5.2.7 — the RE-ANCHORED Claims 5.8 / 5.8' / 5.9 (genuine objects)

This file states and proves the **genuine-object** versions of [BCIKS20] (`2020-654`,
"Proximity Gaps for Reed–Solomon Codes") Claims 5.8, 5.8', and 5.9.

## Why "re-anchored" — the statement-repair rationale (HONESTY FIRST)

The in-tree Claims 5.8/5.8'/5.9 (`ListDecoding/Agreement.lean`, sorried) are phrased about
`BCIKS20AppendixA.ClaimA2.α` / `ClaimA2.β` / `ClaimA2.γ` — the **vacuous** Hensel objects built
on the `β = 0` placeholder (see the honesty notes at `RationalFunctions.β_regular` and
`GammaSubstObstruction.lean`).  That `ClaimA2.γ` is degenerate for `x₀ ≠ 0` (its substitution
fails `HasSubst`) and carries **no** functional relation to `R`.  As `Agreement.lean`'s own §5 GAP
ANALYSIS records, "Claim 5.8 (`α' … t = 0`) is neither provable *nor* refutable from the [opaque
`.choose`]"; the original claims are therefore **unprovable as stated** (kernel-established: the
old `βHensel_lift_identity` statement against `ClaimA2.α` was provably *false* at `t = 0`, see the
`HenselNumerator` §4f statement-repair note).

The **genuine** objects now exist (`GammaGenuine.lean` / `HenselNumerator.lean`, all axiom-clean):

* `gammaGenuine x₀ R H hHyp : (𝕃 H)⟦X⟧` — the genuine Hensel-lift root of the `X`-recentered
  `Y`-polynomial `Q` (`gammaGenuine_constantCoeff = α₀ = T/W`, `gammaGenuine_root : eval γ Q = 0`,
  i.e. the real `R(X, γ, Z) = 0`), PROVEN via the application-shaped Hensel theorem;
* `αGenuine x₀ R hHyp t := PowerSeries.coeff t (gammaGenuine …)` — the genuine coefficient `α_t`;
* `βHensel x₀ R hHyp t : 𝒪 H` — the genuine (A.1) recursive numerator;
* `βHensel_lift_identity` (in-tree) — the lift identity
  `embedding (βHensel … t) = αGenuine t · W^{t+1} · ξ^{2t−1}`, the genuine repair of the old
  identity (against `αGenuine`, NOT the vacuous `ClaimA2.α`), PROVEN from the explicit
  `FaaDiBrunoSuccSumZeroResidual`; and
* `Lemma_A_1` (`RationalFunctions.lean`, PROVEN, axiom-clean) — `#(S_β β') > Λ(β')·d_H ⟹
  embedding β' = 0`, the terminal vanishing the §5 claims consume.

So this file re-anchors Claims 5.8/5.8'/5.9 onto `αGenuine`/`gammaGenuine` and proves them.

## Paper content (fulltext lines ~1576–1721)

* **Claim 5.8** (§5.2.6, "Bounding the X-degree of γ"): *for all `t > k`, `α_t = 0`*, so
  `γ = γ_k = Σ_{t≤k} α_t (X−x₀)^t`.  The route (lines 1672–1681): for the surviving substitution
  set `S'` one has `π_z(β_t) = 0` for many `z`; by Claim A.2 `Λ(β_t) < (2t+1)dD ≤ dD(2D_X−1)`, and
  `(5.14)` gives `|S'| > d_H·Λ(β_t)`; applying **Lemma A.1** to `β_t` yields `β_t = 0` and hence
  `α_t = 0` in `L`.  We take the per-`t` largeness `#(S_β(βHensel … t)) > Λ(βHensel … t)·d_H`
  as the documented hypothesis the §5 callers supply (the `(5.13)`/`(5.14)`-derived bound — we do
  NOT fabricate it), exactly as `Lemma_A_1` consumes it.

* **Claim 5.8'**: hence `γ` is a *polynomial* of X-degree `≤ k` — `γ = γ_k ∈ L[X]`.  We render
  this as the genuine "PowerSeries-is-polynomial" statement: `γ` equals the coercion of its
  truncation `PowerSeries.trunc k γ` to a polynomial, given the tail vanishing `α_t = 0` (`t ≥ k`).

* **Claim 5.9** (§5.2.7, "Bounding the Z-degree of γ"): `γ = v₀(X) + Z·v₁(X) =: P(X,Z)` is
  *linear in Z*.  ATTEMPTED: the smallest faithful named target is carved
  (`gammaGenuine_Z_linear_target`), the per-coefficient reduction is PROVEN
  (`gammaGenuine_Z_linear_of_coeffs_Z_linear`), and the precise obstruction documented (the
  Z-degree-1 structure of the numerators is not yet tracked through the (A.1) recursion).

## Proof route for Claim 5.8 (the load-bearing one, FULLY PROVEN here, AXIOM-CLEAN)

`largeness on βHensel t` → `Lemma_A_1` ⟹ `embedding (βHensel … t) = 0` → the lift identity (taken
as the explicit hypothesis `hlift : LiftIdentityAt`) `embedding (βHensel … t) = αGenuine t ·
W^{t+1} · ξ^{2t−1}` ⟹ `αGenuine t · (W^{t+1}·ξ^{2t−1}) = 0` → the denominator `W^{t+1}·ξ^{2t−1}` is
nonzero (`den_ne_zero`, from `ζ_ne_zero` / `embeddingOf𝒪Into𝕃_ξ_ne_zero`) ⟹ `αGenuine t = 0`.

All statements carry the documented re-anchoring hypotheses; nothing is faked.  The hypothesis-form
claims are axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, no `sorryAx`); the `…_via_intree`
wrappers discharge the lift identity from the in-tree conditional theorem using the explicit
`FaaDiBrunoSuccSumZeroResidual`.  No `sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`/`bv_decide` is used in this file.

/-! ## The §5 largeness hypothesis (the `(5.13)`/`(5.14)`-derived bound)

The genuine, documented hypothesis the §5 callers supply at each coefficient index `t`: the
surviving-substitution set `S_β (βHensel … t)` is larger than `Λ(βHensel … t)·d_H`.  In the paper
this is `(5.14)`/the `Λ(β_t) < (2t+1)dD` bound of Claim A.2 combined with `|S'| > d_H·Λ(β_t)`.
We do **not** fabricate it — it is exactly the hypothesis `Lemma_A_1` consumes, taken as the
input the geometric §5.2.6 argument produces.  Bundled here as a `def` so the claims read
faithfully. -/

/-! ## The lift-identity hypothesis (the `(P2)` numerator/coefficient bridge)

The genuine lift identity `embedding (βHensel … t) = αGenuine t · W^{t+1} · ξ^{2t−1}` connecting
the (A.1) numerator to the genuine coefficient `αGenuine t = coeff t (gammaGenuine …)`.  In-tree
this is `HenselNumerator.βHensel_lift_identity`, which is **PROVEN modulo the single
per-successor-order residual** `FaaDiBrunoSuccSumZeroResidual` — that residual is the only
remaining unproven piece, and it is carried as an explicit hypothesis rather than a hidden axiom.

Per the §5 re-anchoring spec, we therefore take the per-`t` lift identity as an **explicit
documented hypothesis** `LiftIdentityAt` (the bridge the §5 callers supply, exactly as the paper's
Claim A.2 normalization `α_t = β_t / (W^{t+1}·ξ^{e_t})` provides).  The §5 claims below are then
**fully axiom-clean** relative to this hypothesis: they introduce no `sorryAx` of their own.  The
convenience wrappers `…_via_intree` discharge it from `βHensel_lift_identity` and consequently
require the same explicit residual — this is documented, not hidden. -/

/-- The per-`t` lift identity bridge, as a documented hypothesis the §5 callers supply:
`embedding (βHensel … t) = αGenuine t · W^{t+1} · ξ^{2t−1}` (the `(P2)` Claim-A.2 normalization). -/

/-! ## Claim 5.8 (genuine): `α_t = 0` for `t ≥ k` under the §5 largeness hypothesis -/

/-- **The numerator vanishes.**  Under the documented per-`t` largeness hypothesis on
`βHensel … t`, Lemma A.1 forces `embedding (βHensel … t) = 0` in `𝕃 H`.  This is the direct
application of `Lemma_A_1` to the genuine recursive numerator — the terminal vanishing of the
§5.2.6 argument (paper line 1681, "we can therefore apply lemma A.1 to find that indeed `β_t = 0`").
AXIOM-CLEAN (no `sorryAx`): depends only on `Lemma_A_1`. -/

hypothesis on `βHensel … t` (the `(5.14)`-derived bound), the lift-identity bridge `hlift`
(`LiftIdentityAt`), and the genuine Hensel objects, `αGenuine t = 0`.

Route (paper lines 1672–1681): largeness ⟹ (`Lemma_A_1`, via
`embedding_βHensel_eq_zero_of_SβLarge`) `embedding (βHensel … t) = 0`; the lift identity `hlift`
rewrites this as `αGenuine t · (W^{t+1}·ξ^{2t−1}) = 0`; the denominator is nonzero (`den_ne_zero`),
so `αGenuine t = 0`.  No fabricated largeness, no placeholder: this is the genuine `α_t = 0`
(`αGenuine t = coeff t (gammaGenuine …)`).

AXIOM-CLEAN (no `sorryAx`): the lift identity enters only as the explicit hypothesis `hlift`. -/

/-! ## Claim 5.8' (genuine): `γ` is a polynomial of X-degree `< k`

The tail vanishing `αGenuine t = 0` for all `t ≥ k` (from Claim 5.8, with the largeness supplied
for every `t ≥ k` as in the paper's §5.2.6 `S'`-argument) makes `γ = γ_k` a polynomial: `γ` equals
the coercion of its degree-`< k` truncation `PowerSeries.trunc k γ`.  This is the precise
"PowerSeries-is-polynomial" form of `γ = γ_k ∈ L[X]` (fulltext line 1695). -/

/-- **Claim 5.8' (genuine, coefficient/tail form).**  If the §5 largeness holds for *every*
`t ≥ k` and the lift-identity bridge `hlift` holds for every `t ≥ k`, then every coefficient
`α_t` with `t ≥ k` vanishes.  This is the direct `∀`-quantified consequence of `claim58_genuine`
— the tail-vanishing statement that `γ = γ_k`.  AXIOM-CLEAN. -/

*equals the coercion of its degree-`< k` truncation polynomial* `PowerSeries.trunc k (gammaGenuine)`.
This is the machine-checkable "γ is a polynomial of X-degree `< k`" (`γ = γ_k ∈ L[X]`,
fulltext 1695): for every coefficient index `t`, the series and the (coerced) truncation agree —
below `k` by `coeff_trunc`, at/above `k` because both are `0` (the truncation by `coeff_trunc`, the
series by Claim 5.8 / `claim58prime_genuine_tail`).  Proven from the same `∀ t ≥ k` largeness +

/-! ## Claim 5.9 (ATTEMPTED): `γ` is linear in `Z`

Paper §5.2.7 (fulltext 1707–1740): the coefficients of `γ = γ_k ∈ L[X]` are in fact *linear
polynomials in `Z`*, so `γ = v₀(X) + Z·v₁(X) =: P(X, Z)` with X-degree `≤ k` and Z-degree `≤ 1`.

CARVED TARGET + PRECISE OBSTRUCTION.  The genuine Z-degree statement requires tracking the
`Z`-degree of the numerators `βHensel … t` through the (A.1) recursion and the lift identity into
`αGenuine t`, then assembling `γ`.  The in-tree machinery has the `X`/`Y`-degree calculus
(`weight_Λ`, `natDegreeY`, the `Y`-Hasse degree drop) and the `Z`-weight enters only through the
`degreeX` component of `weight_Λ_over_𝒪` (the `(f.coeff deg).natDegree` summand) — but there is no
lemma yet bounding the `Z`-degree (the `RatFunc F` / ground-layer degree) of `αGenuine t` by `1`.
The paper proves Z-linearity *geometrically* (via `≥ k+1` good `x`-values with enough
`Z`-substitutions, then interpolation, lines 1719–1740) — a different argument from the §5.2.6
degree-bound route, and not reducible to the lift identity alone.

We therefore carve the smallest faithful named *target* (`gammaGenuine_Z_linear_target`): existence
of `v₀, v₁ : (𝕃 H)⟦X⟧` (with `F[X]`-image, i.e. Z-degree-`0`, coefficients) such that
`γ = v₀ + C(functionFieldT) · v₁` (the `Z = T` linear form in `𝕃 H`).  Proving the target is left
as the documented obstruction; the per-coefficient reduction
`gammaGenuine_Z_linear_of_coeffs_Z_linear` (PROVEN) shows it follows from per-coefficient
Z-linearity of the `α_t`, isolating exactly the missing `Z`-degree-1 fact. -/

/-- Z-linearity TARGET for `γ` (Claim 5.9), in the genuine function field `𝕃 H` where `Z`'s image
is `functionFieldT`.  `γ = v₀(X) + functionFieldT · v₁(X)` as power series, with the `v_i` having
coefficients that are images of `F`-rational data (Z-degree `0`).  This is the faithful rendering
of `γ = v₀(X) + Z·v₁(X)` (fulltext 1713). -/

/-- **Claim 5.9 reduction (PROVEN, AXIOM-CLEAN).**  The Z-linearity target follows from
*per-coefficient* Z-linearity of `γ`: if every coefficient `αGenuine t = coeff t γ` is of the form
`liftToFunctionField c₀ + functionFieldT · liftToFunctionField c₁` for some `c₀, c₁ : F[X]`
(the `Z`-degree-`≤1` shape, `Z ↦ T`), then `γ` itself is Z-linear with
`v_i := PowerSeries.mk (fun t => liftToFunctionField (c_i t))`.  This isolates the remaining content
of Claim 5.9 into the per-coefficient `Z`-degree-1 fact (the documented obstruction). -/

`claim58prime_genuine_tail`, `embedding_βHensel_eq_zero_of_SβLarge`,
`claim58prime_genuine_natDegree_lt`, `gammaGenuine_Z_linear_of_coeffs_Z_linear`) reduce only to the
ambient `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` — **no `sorryAx`**, no
`native_decide`/`bv_decide`/`admit` (none used): they take the lift identity as the explicit
documented hypothesis `LiftIdentityAt`.

The `…_via_intree` wrappers discharge `hlift` from `HenselNumerator.βHensel_lift_identity`, which is
PROVEN from the explicit residual `FaaDiBrunoSuccSumZeroResidual`.  These wrappers therefore remain
axiom-clean relative to that hypothesis; no hidden `sorryAx` is introduced here.

These `#print axioms` lines are checked at compile time. -/
