# The base case of the strict-coefficient share reduction (#389)

`StrictCoeffPolysShareResidual ℓ T` weakens the original strict-coefficient residual
`StrictCoeffPolysResidual` by allowing the recovered coefficient polynomials to match `P` on only a
*sub-share* `G' ⊆ good` of the good set, subject to the budget `|good| ≤ T + ℓ·|G'|`.  The trivial
corner `(ℓ, T) = (1, 0)` is the original residual: the budget `|good| ≤ |G'|` with `G' ⊆ good`
forces `G' = good`, so the share matching is matching on the whole good set.

Together with the proven reverse implication
`strictCoeffPolysShareResidual_of_strictCoeffPolysResidual`, this pins the `(1, 0)` corner of the
share family to the base residual — confirming the share family is a genuine *generalization*
(strictly weaker for `ℓ > 1` or `T > 0`) that degenerates exactly to the base at its trivial corner.

/-- **Base case of the share reduction.**  The share residual at the trivial share `ℓ = 1`,
budget `T = 0` implies the original (full-good-set) strict-coefficient residual: there `G' ⊆ good`
with `|good| ≤ 0 + 1·|G'|` forces `G' = good` (`Finset.eq_of_subset_of_card_le`), so the
coefficient-matching on `G'` is matching on the whole good set. -/
