# BCIKS20 Appendix A.4 — monic consequences of the proven Faà-di-Bruno match

`P2MatchMonic.restrictedFaaDiBrunoMatch_of_monic` proves the carved P2 core
`RestrictedFaaDiBrunoMatch` for monic `H` (axiom-clean, all orders). This file propagates that
genuine theorem through the *already-proven* `_of_restrictedMatch` bridges, turning every
match-conditional P2 obligation into a monic-unconditional theorem (no `axiom`, no `sorry`, no
residual hypothesis):

* `faaDiBrunoSuccSumZeroResidual_of_leadingCoeff_one` — the legacy successor-sum P2 residual
  (consumed by the §5 / `P1Conditional` / `StrictCoeffPolys` chain) holds for monic `H`.
* `lift_identity_of_leadingCoeff_one` — the order-by-order lift identity
  `embed(βHensel t) = αGenuine t · W^{t+1} · ξ^{2t-1}`, i.e. the `hlift` hypothesis of
  `alphaWeight_iff_divWeight`, is now a *theorem* for monic `H`.

The remaining open content of BCIKS20 A.4 is the **P1 weight-1 core** (`DivWeightLe` /
`AlphaGenuineRegularWeightLe`): that `αGenuine t` is the embedding of an `𝒪`-element of
`Λ_𝒪`-weight `≤ 1`. By `alphaWeight_iff_divWeight` this is an `𝒪`-divisibility-with-weight fact,
*distinct* from the lift identity proven here, and genuinely open (see issue #138). It is NOT
discharged here.

/-- **Monic ⟹ the order-by-order lift identity (fully proven, axiom-clean).**

This is exactly the `hlift` hypothesis required by `alphaWeight_iff_divWeight`; for monic `H` it is
now a theorem, so the P1 ⟺ `DivWeightLe` equivalence holds unconditionally and the *only* remaining
P1 content is the weight-1 quotient bound (open, #138). -/

  (P2_closed_of_leadingCoeff_one H x₀ R hHyp hlc).2

/-- **Monic ⟹ P1 ⟺ `DivWeightLe`, with `hlift` discharged.** Given monic `H`, the carved
regularity form `AlphaGenuineRegularWeightLe` and the `𝒪`-divisibility form `DivWeightLe` are
equivalent — the lift identity (`hlift`) is supplied by `lift_identity_of_leadingCoeff_one`. The
common content (the weight-1 quotient) remains open (#138). -/
