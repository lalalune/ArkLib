# Finding 14 countermodel: the in-tree (A.1) cell coefficient is NOT the paper's cleared B

[BCIKS20] Appendix A.4 (lines 4060–4210) runs the `(A.1)` recursion with the W-TWISTED
cell coefficients `B_{i1,λ} = W^{d−δ−Σλ}·A_{i1,λ}`, where `A` evaluates the iterated Hasse
coefficient at `α₀ = T/W` — per monomial `c_b·W^{d−δ−Σλ−b}·T^b` (the in-tree analogue is
`hasseCoeffRepr𝒪_cleared`). The in-tree `B_coeff` instead `mk`s the UN-cleared `Y ↦ T`
lift `Σ_b c_b·T^b`, while `βHensel_succ` copies the paper's engine exponents verbatim.

This file gives the **machine-checked separation** (DISPROOF_LOG O156): a concrete
instance — `F = ZMod 5`, `H = Z·Y + 1` (non-monic, `W = Z`), `R = Z·Y² + Y + X`,
`x₀ = 0`, satisfying `ClaimA2.Hypotheses` — in which the in-tree order-1 numerator
`β₁ = −B_coeff(1,∅)` (the proven `βHensel_one`) differs from the paper's cleared value
`−⟦cleared at k = d_R − δ − Σλ = 2⟧` as elements of `𝒪 H`:

`βHensel 1 = −1 ≠ −Z² = −(paper's β₁)`.

Hence the in-tree recursion and the paper's `(A.1)` produce DIFFERENT sequences from
order 1 on (for non-monic `H`), confirming finding 14's normalization divergence at the
level of the recursion's values. (Which of the two satisfies the genuine Hensel lift
identity is settled by the paper's derivation: the cleared one.)
