# (P1, A.4) The cleared-vs-uncleared obstruction for `AlphaGenuineRegularWeightLe`

This module settles, axiom-clean, *why* the P1 weight-1 regularity invariant
`AlphaGenuineRegularWeightLe` resists discharge, and what the corrected statement is.  It is the
machine-checked form of the in-source WAVE-5 diagnosis in `HenselNumerator.lean` ("EXACT MISSING
INGREDIENT #2": *each `αGenuine l` must be represented by an `𝒪`-element of weight at most `1`*).

## Main results

* `liftBivariate_eq_zero_of_natDegree_lt` — `liftBivariate` is injective on polynomials of
  `Y`-degree `< H.natDegree`: such polynomials sit strictly below the modulus `H̃ = H_tilde'`, so
  they inject faithfully into `𝕃 H`.  (Reusable; the engine for both directions below.)

* `αGenuine_zero_not_regular` — for non-monic `H` (`H.leadingCoeff` not a unit, `2 ≤ H.natDegree`)
  **no** `𝒪`-element embeds to `αGenuine 0 = α₀ = T / W`.  The base coefficient is the un-cleared
  `T/W`, which is not integral when `W = H.leadingCoeff` is a non-unit: the equation
  `embedding a = T/W` clears to `canonicalRep a · C lc = X` below the modulus, forcing
  `(canonicalRep a).coeff 1 · lc = 1`, i.e. `lc` a unit.

* `not_alphaGenuineRegularWeightLe_zero` / `not_alphaGenuineRegularWeightLe` — consequently the
  base case (hence the full all-orders invariant) of `AlphaGenuineRegularWeightLe` is **false** for
  non-monic `H`, independent of the weight bound.

These results are the *complement* to the corrected predicate
`AlphaWeight.AlphaGenuineRegularWeightLe_zero_cleared` and the witness
`AlphaWeight.alphaWeight_zero_cleared_fixed` (both already on `main`): those prove the *cleared*
coefficient `W · αGenuine 0 = T` has an `𝒪`-witness of weight `≤ 1` (namely `βHensel 0`), while the
results here prove the *un-cleared* `αGenuine 0 = T/W` has **no** such witness.  Together they show
the `_cleared` rename is necessary, not cosmetic: the original invariant is false and the cleared
one holds.

The take-away mirrors the (P2) `RestrictedFaaDiBrunoMatch` situation (issues #138 / #139): both
sides demand a weight-1 / Newton representative of an *un-cleared* coefficient that is not integral
for non-monic `H`; restating on the cleared coefficient is the single correction.

/-- `liftBivariate` kills only the zero polynomial below `Y`-degree `H.natDegree`: a polynomial of
`Y`-degree `< H.natDegree` lies strictly under the modulus `H̃`, so its image in `𝕃 H` is faithful.
Proof: `liftBivariate q = 0 ↔ H̃ ∣ bivPolyHom q`; via `H_tilde_equiv_H_tilde'` and
`natDegree_H_tilde'` the divisor has `Y`-degree `H.natDegree`, so the lower-degree `q` is `0`. -/
