# BCIKS20 list-decoding agreement compatibility module

The historical Claim 5.7 agreement development was split out of the current
local ArkLib worktree.  `ArkLib.lean` still imports this module as part of the
public package surface, so this file intentionally preserves that import target
while the active list-decoding definitions live in `Extraction` and
`Guruswami`.

/-! ### GAP ANALYSIS for the §5 list-decoding agreement claims (5.7 – 5.11)

This file's six claims sit on top of three still-open §5 ingredients that no lemma currently
supplies. The gaps below were determined by a complete dependency audit; each is a *precise*
missing fact (not a proof-engineering hurdle), so the claims are documented as blocked rather
than discharged with `sorry`-laundering. No statement is weakened.

* **Missing ingredient A — "`S` is large".** There is *no* hypothesis or lemma giving a lower
  bound on `#(coeffs_of_close_proximity k ωs δ u₀ u₁)`. In [BCIKS20, §5] the inequality
  `#S / D_Y(Q) > 2·D_Y(Q)²·D_X·D_YZ(Q)` is a *standing hypothesis* of the proximity-gap regime
  (the "many close codewords" assumption), not a consequence of `ModifiedGuruswami`. It is
  directly the second conjunct of Claim 5.7 and is `R,H`-independent, hence unprovable from the
  current hypotheses. See `exists_factors_with_large_common_root_set`.

* **Missing ingredient B — "`Q` vanishes at every close `z`".** No proven fact asserts
  `(Trivariate.eval_on_Z Q z).eval (Pz …) = 0` for `z ∈ coeffs_of_close_proximity`. This is
  [BCIKS20, Lemma 5.3] (GS divisibility `(Y − Pz) ∣ Q`) lifted to the `Z`-curve. In
  `Extraction.lean` it appears only as the *antecedent* `→` of `pg_exists_R_of_Q_eval_zero` /
  `pg_exists_pair_for_z`, never as a standalone lemma. Without it the pigeonhole giving the
  first conjunct of Claim 5.7 cannot reach `#S / D_Y(Q)` (it only reaches
  `#(vanishing z) / D_Y(Q)`).

* **Missing ingredient C — the Appendix-A ↔ §5 bridge.** `RationalFunctions.lean` contains the
  vanishing criterion `Lemma_A_1` (`#(S_β β) > Λ(β)·dₕ ⟹ embeddingOf𝒪Into𝕃 β = 0`) and the
  forward inclusion `eval_resultant_eq_zero_of_mem_S_β`, but **no** lemma relating the
  Appendix-A objects (`α`, `γ`, `β`, `S_β`, `π_z`) to the §5 geometric data
  (`Pz`, `matching_set`, the word `w(x,z) = u₀ x + z·u₁ x`, `ωs`). Concretely, the converse
  direction "a geometric matching point `z` lies in `S_β (β R t)` (i.e. `π_z (β R t) = 0`)" is
  absent. This bridge is the entire substance of the proofs of Claims 5.8–5.11.

* **Missing ingredient D — `β`/`α`/`γ` are *under-specified* (root cause for 5.8/5.8'/5.9).**
  In `RationalFunctions.lean`, `β R t := (β_regular …).choose`, and `β_regular` asserts only the
  *existence* of a regular element satisfying the weight *upper* bound `Λ(β) ≤ (2t+1)·d_R·D`; it
  is realized with the trivial witness `β = 0` (`fun _ => ⟨0, by simp⟩`). Thus `β R t` is *some*
  opaque `.choose` element constrained only by that upper bound — it does **not** encode the
  recursive Hensel-lift numerator of [BCIKS20, Appendix A.4], and carries no functional relation
  to `R`, `x₀`, or the lift recursion. Consequently `α' … t = embeddingOf𝒪Into𝕃 _ (β R t) / _`
  is **underdetermined**: its value at `t ≥ k` is *not fixed* by the definitions (it depends on
  the opaque `.choose`), so Claim 5.8 (`α' … t = 0`) is neither provable *nor* refutable from the
  current `β` — it is true only under the intended (not-yet-formalized) Hensel construction.
  Even granting ingredient C, the `S_β`-largeness argument cannot be invoked because the `β` it
  must apply to is not the Hensel numerator. Closing 5.8/5.8'/5.9 therefore requires first
  *replacing* `β_regular`'s trivial realization with the genuine recursive Hensel-lift definition
  (the `β`-construction of Appendix A.4) so that `β R t` is a *function of* the lift data, not an
  arbitrary weight-bounded witness.

**Per-claim disposition.**
- 5.7 (`exists_factors_with_large_common_root_set`): blocked on A (final conjunct, unprovable as
  stated — needs an added `#S` lower-bound hypothesis) and B (first conjunct pigeonhole). The
  `R, H, Irreducible, natDegree, dvd, Separable` conjuncts are supplied by `Extraction.lean`'s
  `pg_*` toolbox + Claim 5.6, but the two cardinality conjuncts are not.
- 5.8 (`approximate_solution_is_exact_solution_coeffs`): reduces cleanly to
  `embeddingOf𝒪Into𝕃 _ (β (R …) t) = 0` (since `α' … t = embeddingOf𝒪Into𝕃 _ (β …) / _`, so
  `zero_div`), which is exactly `Lemma_A_1`'s conclusion — but `Lemma_A_1`'s hypothesis
  `#(S_β (β … t)) > Λ·dₕ` has no supplier (ingredient C). Deeper still (ingredient D), `β R t`
  is an opaque weight-bounded `.choose` rather than the Hensel numerator, so `α' … t` is
  *underdetermined* and `α' … t = 0` is neither provable nor refutable from the current `β`.
- 5.8' (`…_coeffs'`): would follow from 5.8 by `PowerSeries.subst` bookkeeping on `γ = subst …
  (mk α)`, but 5.8 is itself blocked, so 5.8' cannot stand alone.
- 5.9 (`solution_gamma_is_linear_in_Z`): consumes 5.8' (truncation of `γ` to degree `< k`,
  combined with the `degreeX P ≤ 1` output of Prop 5.5); blocked transitively.
- 5.10 (`solution_gamma_matches_word_if_subset_large`): its hypothesis `hx` bounds
  `(matching_set_at_x …).card`, but converting that into the `S_β`-largeness that `Lemma_A_1`
  consumes is exactly ingredient C; blocked.
- 5.11 (`exists_points_with_large_matching_subset`): double-counting over the matching set,
  which is `.choose` of the still-`sorry` Prop 5.5 (`exists_a_set_and_a_matching_polynomial`);
  blocked on that upstream `sorry` plus ingredient C.

Closing any of these honestly requires first landing (i) an `#S` lower-bound hypothesis on
`ModifiedGuruswami` (or on Claim 5.7), (ii) the Lemma-5.3 `Z`-curve divisibility bridge, and
(iii) the Appendix-A ↔ §5 specialization bridge `matching point ⟹ π_z (β R t) = 0`. None are
present in the current tree. -/

/-! ### Gap B — the trivariate graph-vanishing keystone (NOW RESOLVED)

The residual "Gap B" obstruction flagged on `exists_factors_with_large_common_root_set` and on
`exists_a_set_and_a_matching_polynomial` was: *no lemma connects `ModifiedGuruswami.Q_multiplicity`
(order-`≥ m` root multiplicity of `Q : F[Z][X][Y]` over the coefficient ring `F[Z]` at each curve
point `(C ωᵢ, C u₀ᵢ + X · C u₁ᵢ)`) to the per-`z` evaluation-zero fact `(eval_on_Z Q z).eval Pz =
0`* — i.e. "`Q` vanishes on the graph `(X, Pz(X))` of the `δ`-close codeword indexed by `z`".

The lemmas below **supply that bridge**, fully proven (`#print axioms` = `propext`,
`Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound` only).  The argument is the trivariate analogue of the bivariate
GS divisibility chain (`GuruswamiSudan.orderAt_eval_ge` / `roots_le_degree_of_deg_lt_roots`):

1. **Multiplicity transport `F[Z] → F`** (`gapB_transport_mult`).  Applying the coefficient ring
   hom `φ = evalRingHom z : F[Z] → F` (`Z ↦ z`) commutes with both `Bivariate.shift` and
   `Bivariate.coeff` (`gapB_shift_map`, `gapB_coeff_map_biv`).  Hence the order-`m` vanishing of the
   shifted coefficients of `Q` at `(C ωᵢ, C u₀ᵢ + X·C u₁ᵢ)` (extracted from `Q_multiplicity` via the
   integral-domain criterion `gapB_shift_coeff_zero_of_mult_ge_dom`) transports to order-`m`
   vanishing of `eval_on_Z Q z = Q.map (mapRingHom φ)` at the *image* point
   `(φ(C ωᵢ), φ(C u₀ᵢ + X·C u₁ᵢ)) = (ωᵢ, u₀ᵢ + z·u₁ᵢ) = (ωᵢ, (u₀ + z•u₁) i)` — exactly the word
   `w(·, z)`.  This is the field-side input `GuruswamiSudan.rootMultiplicity_ge_of_shift_zero`.

2. **Field-side graph vanishing** (`gapB_vanish_of_orderM_and_count`).  With `Q_z := eval_on_Z Q z`
   carrying order-`m` roots at `(ωᵢ, w_i)` for `i` in the agreement set `A`, `Q_z(X, Pz(X))` has a
   root of order `≥ m` at each `ωᵢ` with `i ∈ A` (`GuruswamiSudan.orderAt_eval_ge`); a polynomial of
   degree `< m·#A` with that many roots is `0` (`roots_le_degree_of_deg_lt_roots`).  The degree
   bound `(Q_z.eval Pz).natDegree ≤ natWeightedDegree Q_z 1 k` is `degree_eval_le_weightedDegree`
   (`Pz.natDegree ≤ k`).

The strict counting inequality `natWeightedDegree (eval_on_Z Q z) 1 k < m·#A` is the
*Johnson-radius* condition — `δ` within the list-decoding radius so that `#A ≥ (1−δ)n` is large
relative to the degree bound.  It is passed as an explicit hypothesis of the keystone:
`exists_factors_with_large_common_root_set` does **not** carry a `δ ≤ δ₀` binder (its `δ` is free),
which is precisely why that top-level claim still cannot be closed without statement repair (see its
docstring).  The keystone is the faithful, reusable form of the bridge: feed it the Johnson side
condition and it discharges the graph vanishing. -/

This is the fact previously declared missing on `exists_factors_with_large_common_root_set`
("Missing GS-multiplicity → close-codeword-graph vanishing (Gap B)") and on
`exists_a_set_and_a_matching_polynomial` ("the binding of each `z ∈ S` to a factor requires the
vanishing `(eval_on_Z Q z).eval Pz = 0`").  It is derived honestly from
`ModifiedGuruswami.Q_multiplicity` via the transport + field-side counting lemmas above; the
Johnson-radius side condition is made explicit because the consumer claims do not carry a `δ ≤ δ₀`
binder (their `δ` is free), so it cannot be discharged internally — see the obstruction docstrings.
`#print axioms` = `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound` only. -/

/-- *Keystone ⟹ the `hdiv` divisibility hypothesis of the extraction toolbox.*  The factor theorem
turns the keystone's graph-vanishing `(pg_eval_on_Z Q z).eval (Pz) = 0` into the linear-factor
divisibility `X - C (Pz) ∣ pg_eval_on_Z Q z` — which is *verbatim* the per-`z` hypothesis `hdiv`
of `pg_exists_common_candidate_pair_of_dvd` /
`pg_exists_common_candidate_pair_of_dvd_card_natDegreeY`.

This is the maximal honest reach of the Gap-B keystone toward Claim 5.7: it supplies, for any
single `z ∈ S` equipped with an agreement set `A` satisfying the Johnson count
`m·#A > natWeightedDegree …`, the exact divisibility the first-conjunct pigeonhole needs.  Closing
the *whole* of Claim 5.7 from
here is still blocked — `hdiv` must hold for **every** `z ∈ S` simultaneously, which requires the
Johnson count for every `z`, i.e. a `δ ≤ δ₀` binder absent from the (uneditable) statement; and the
second cardinality conjunct of Claim 5.7 is independently false off the list-decoding regime
(`Extraction.c57_second_conjunct_unsat_of_S_empty`).  See the obstruction docstring on

Claim 5.7 of [BCIKS20].

OBSTRUCTION (one residual blocker remains — the trivariate vanishing bridge).

* *Sealed `eval_on_Z` (Gap A — NOW RESOLVED).*  Previously `Trivariate.eval_on_Z` was declared
  `opaque`, so **no** property of `eval_on_Z R z.1` (which appears in the `S'`-membership predicate
  `(Trivariate.eval_on_Z R z.1).eval Pz = 0 ∧ …`) was derivable — not `eval_on_Z 0 z = 0`, not
  additivity, not `eval_on_Z p z = pg_eval_on_Z p z` (the last failed `rfl` despite identical
  bodies, since `opaque` blocks delta-reduction).  `eval_on_Z` has since been **de-sealed** to a
  transparent `def` with equation lemma `Trivariate.eval_on_Z_eq` (`Trivariate.lean`).  The
  companion lemmas `c57_eval_on_Z_eq_pg` (`eval_on_Z = pg_eval_on_Z`), `c57_eval_on_Z_zero`,
  `c57_eval_on_Z_add`, `c57_eval_on_Z_mul` (above) now all *prove*, so the `S'` predicate is fully
  reasonable about and Gap A is no longer an obstruction.  (The statement is left referencing
  `Trivariate.eval_on_Z` directly — now sound — so the `R`/`H`/`Irreducible H` consumers, which read
  only `.choose`, `.choose_spec.choose`, `.choose_spec.choose_spec.2.1`, are unaffected.)

* *GS-multiplicity → close-codeword-graph vanishing (Gap B — NOW RESOLVED).*  The pigeonhole needs,
  for each `z ∈ S`, the vanishing `(eval_on_Z Q z.1).eval (Pz z.2) = 0` — the formal content of "`Q`
  vanishes on the graphs of the `δ`-close codewords", obtained from the `ModifiedGuruswami`
  multiplicity field `Q_multiplicity` together with the `Pz`-matching data of Proposition 5.5.  This
  bridge is now **supplied and fully proven** by `Q_vanishes_on_close_codeword_graph` (above): the
  trivariate analogue of the bivariate `GuruswamiSudan.orderAt_eval_ge` /
  `roots_le_degree_of_deg_lt_roots` chain, transporting the order-`≥ m` root multiplicity of `Q`
  over `F[Z]` at `(C ωᵢ, C(u₀ᵢ) + X·C(u₁ᵢ))` under `Z ↦ z` (`gapB_transport_mult`) to order-`≥ m`
  vanishing of `eval_on_Z Q z` at the word point `(ωᵢ, (u₀ + z•u₁) i)`, then a degree-vs-roots count
  (`gapB_vanish_of_orderM_and_count`).  `#print axioms` is clean.
  *Verified residual side hypothesis (NOT in this binder):* the count requires the strict inequality
  `m·#A > natWeightedDegree (eval_on_Z Q z) 1 k` (with `#A ≥ (1−δ)n` the agreement count), i.e. `δ`
  within the Johnson radius `proximity_gap_johnson`.  `δ` is a *free* parameter of this Claim-5.7
  lemma (no `δ ≤ δ₀` hypothesis), so for `δ` near `1` the vanishing genuinely fails; the keystone
  therefore takes that Johnson/count condition as an *explicit hypothesis*.  Closing Claim 5.7 from
  the keystone is thus blocked only on adding the absent `δ ≤ δ₀` binder — a statement repair the
  uneditable downstream consumers forbid (see the second-conjunct note below).

* *Second cardinality conjunct is false off the list-decoding regime (VERIFIED defect, the 7th in
  this tree).*  The conjunct `(#S : ℝ)/(D_Y Q) > 2·D_Y Q²·D_X·D_YZ Q` is a *lower bound on `#S`*
  (`S = coeffs_of_close_proximity`) that does not follow from `ModifiedGuruswami`: for `δ < 0` (and
  `0 < n`) the set `S` is **empty** (`Extraction.coeffs_of_close_proximity_eq_empty_of_neg`), so the
  LHS is `0`, while the RHS is `≥ 0` always (`Extraction.c57_rhs_nonneg`); hence `0 > (≥0)` is
  false (`Extraction.c57_second_conjunct_unsat_of_S_empty`).  In [BCIKS20] this inequality is a
  *hypothesis* (`S` large — the list-decoding case), mis-placed into the conclusion; the faithful
  fix carries it (and the Johnson bound above) as side hypotheses, which the uneditable consumer
  signatures `(δ) (x₀) (h_gs)` of `R`/`H`/`irreducible_H`/Claims-5.8–5.11 do not admit.

With Gap A resolved, the proof obligation is retained pending the Gap-B vanishing bridge (which
  itself
needs the absent `δ ≤ δ₀` hypothesis), the false-off-regime second conjunct, and the upstream
Prop 5.5.  The binder structure `∃ R H, R ∈ … ∧ Irreducible H ∧ …` is preserved so the
downstream extractors stay well-typed. -/
/-- Proved, side-condition-explicit form of the Claim 5.7 candidate-pair extraction.

This packages the already-proved `pg_exists_common_candidate_pair_of_dvd_card_natDegreeY` into the
factor-properties shape used by the §5 agreement chain, but it intentionally targets `pg_Rset`
rather than the stronger Eq. 5.12 factorization list.  The missing work for the original
free-parameter Claim 5.7 is now isolated in the hypotheses here: nonvanishing/separability of the
`x₀` specialization, nonempty close set, graph divisibility for every close `z`, and the large-set
Johnson-regime inequality. -/

`α_t`-style weight invariant into the loose numeric bound
`Λ(β_t) ≤ (2t+1)·d_R·D`.  Therefore a geometric count that is larger than this

GAP (blocked — see the §5 GAP ANALYSIS block above). `α' x₀ R … t = embeddingOf𝒪Into𝕃 _ (β R t)
/ (W^(t+1) · ξ-emb^(2t-1))`, so the goal reduces by `zero_div` to `embeddingOf𝒪Into𝕃 _ (β R t)
= 0`, which is the conclusion of `Lemma_A_1`. But `Lemma_A_1`'s hypothesis `#(S_β (β R t)) >
Λ(β R t)·dₕ` has no supplier (missing ingredient C), and more fundamentally `β R t` is an opaque
weight-bounded `.choose`, not the recursive Hensel numerator (missing ingredient D), so the
conclusion is underdetermined by the current definitions. -/

GAP (blocked — see the §5 GAP ANALYSIS block above). Equivalent to `coeff t γ' = 0` for `t ≥ k`.
Would follow from the coefficient form (`approximate_solution_is_exact_solution_coeffs`) by
`PowerSeries.subst` bookkeeping on `γ = subst (mk shift) (mk α)`, but that form is itself blocked

/-- The set `S'` from [BCIKS20] (just before Claim 5.10): the sub-collection of close coefficients
`z ∈ S = coeffs_of_close_proximity` that are bound to the common irreducible factor pair `(R, H)`
selected by the Claim-5.7 pigeonhole.

REPAIR NOTE (pre-existing breakage). `matching_set`,
`matching_set_is_a_sub_of_coeffs_of_close_proximity`, and the upstream Prop 5.5
`exists_a_set_and_a_matching_polynomial` were *referenced* by `matching_set_at_x` and by the §5 GAP
docstrings but never **defined** anywhere in the tree, so this file — and the entire BCIKS20 §5
downstream including `correlatedAgreement_affine_curves` — failed to compile with
`Unknown identifier matching_set`.  We supply the missing definition here.

Faithfulness: in [BCIKS20] `S' ⊆ S` is the fiber bound to the chosen `(R, H)`.  Pinning that fiber
formally would force `matching_set` to carry the Claim-5.7 `.choose` data `R k δ x₀ h_gs` (hence an
extra `x₀` parameter the uneditable call site `matching_set k ωs δ u₀ u₁ h_gs` does not pass).  We
therefore define `S' := S` (the maximal subset) — an honest *over-approximation* of the paper's
`S'`. This only ever **weakens** the cardinality hypotheses of the still-`sorry` Claims 5.10/5.11
(a larger
`S'` makes `|S'_x|` larger, so their hypotheses are easier, not vacuous), and the inclusion
`S' ⊆ S` holds by `id`.  No proven statement is affected. -/

/-- Claim 5.10 of [BCIKS20].
Needed to prove Claim 5.9. This claim states that `γ(x) = w(x,Z)` if the cardinality `|S'_x|` is big
enough.

GAP (blocked — see the §5 GAP ANALYSIS block above). The hypothesis `hx` bounds
`(matching_set_at_x …).card` from below, and the conclusion is the §5 polynomial identity
`P(ωs x) = C(u₀ x) + u₁ x · X`. Bridging the geometric matching-set bound to the `S_β`-largeness
that `Lemma_A_1` consumes (so that the relevant Hensel coefficient vanishes) is exactly missing
ingredient C; the underlying `β` under-specification (ingredient D) also applies. -/
