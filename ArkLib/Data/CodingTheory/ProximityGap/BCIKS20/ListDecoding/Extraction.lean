/-- Equation 5.12 from [BCIKS20].

NOTE (statement repair): the original formulation of this lemma was *vacuous*.
Because `∧` binds tighter than the bounded quantifier `∀ _ ∈ _,`, the entire
payload — separability of each `Rᵢ`, irreducibility of each `Rᵢ`, and the
factorization equation `Q = C · ∏ (Rᵢ.comp Xᶠ)^eᵢ` — was trapped inside the
`∀ eᵢ ∈ e, …` (and the nested `∀ Rᵢ ∈ R, …`) binders. The statement was then
satisfiable by the empty witnesses `C = …, R = [], f = [], e = []` (all three
length equalities collapse to `0 = 0` and `∀ eᵢ ∈ [], …` is vacuously true),
carrying no mathematical content whatsoever.

This re-parenthesizes to the intended reading of [BCIKS20, Eq. 5.12]: each
bounded quantifier and the final factorization equation is now a *separate*
top-level conjunct, so the factorization holds outside all of the binders.
No conjunct has been dropped or weakened; only the scoping was corrected.

OBSTRUCTION (statement still mis-specified — see `eq512_cartesian_product_blowup`).
After the scoping repair the lemma remains **unprovable as written** for a general
`ModifiedGuruswami` solution `Q`, for two independent reasons:

* *Cartesian (not zipped) product indexing.* The factorization conjunct is
  `Q = C · ∏ (Rᵢ ∈ R.toFinset) (fᵢ ∈ f.toFinset) (eᵢ ∈ e.toFinset), (Rᵢ.comp Xᶠⁱ)^eᵢ`,
  i.e. a product over the **Cartesian product** of three independent finsets, rather
  than the intended single index `∏ᵢ (Rᵢ.comp X^(f i))^(e i)` of [BCIKS20, Eq. 5.12]
  that *pairs* the `i`-th factor, exponent and multiplicity. Consequently each factor
  `Rᵢ` is forced to the common power `∑ (eᵢ ∈ e.toFinset)` and replicated across every
  `fᵢ ∈ f.toFinset`, so the equation can only reproduce a `Q` whose distinct irreducible
  factors share a single multiplicity and a single contraction exponent. The companion
  lemma `eq512_cartesian_product_blowup` (below) makes this concrete: the *intended*
  witnesses `R = [a, b]`, `f = [1, 1]`, `e = [1, 2]` for `Q = a · b²` instead evaluate
  the displayed product to `a³ · b³`. No choice of `C, R, f, e` satisfying the
  separability and irreducibility conjuncts reproduces a general factored `Q` (e.g.
  `g · h²` with `g ≠ h` distinct separable irreducibles).

* *Separability over the wrong ring (VERIFIED defect, bug #18 — see
  `eq512_strong_separable_unsat`).* The original conjunct `∀ Rᵢ ∈ R, Rᵢ.Separable` applied
  `Polynomial.Separable` to `Rᵢ : F[Z][X][Y]` over the **coefficient ring** `F[Z][X]`, which
  is *not a field*. By `separable_def`, this unfolds to a Bézout identity
  `a · Rᵢ + b · Rᵢ.derivative = 1` with `a, b : F[Z][X][Y]` — coprimality *in the polynomial
  ring* — which is **unsatisfiable** for genuinely-arising irreducible factors: the companion
  witness `eq512_strong_separable_unsat` proves that `Y² − X` (an irreducible, squarefree,
  fraction-field-separable factor of the shape a `ModifiedGuruswami` solution produces, since
  `D_Y Q < D_X / k` permits `Y`-degree ≥ 2) is **not** `Separable` over `F[Z][X]`, because
  `Separable.map` would force its `Z, X ↦ 0` image `Y²` to be squarefree. The paper means
  separability of `Rᵢ` over the *fraction field* `F(Z,X)`, equivalently nonvanishing of
  `discr_y` — precisely the form consumed by Claim 5.6 (`discr_of_irred_components_nonzero`,
  which evaluates `Bivariate.discr_y R`). This is the **repaired** conjunct below:
  `(Rᵢ.map (algebraMap (F[Z][X]) (FractionRing (F[Z][X])))).Separable`. The binder structure
  `(C, R, f, e)` and conjunct count are unchanged, so all `.choose`/`.choose_spec.choose`
  consumers (Claim 5.6, Claim 5.7 in `Agreement.lean`) are unaffected.

The factorization conjunct uses the **zipped** indexed product
`∏ i ∈ Finset.range R.length, (Rᵢ.comp X^fᵢ)^eᵢ` (paper-faithful), repairing the earlier
Cartesian-product mis-indexing witnessed by `eq512_cartesian_product_blowup`. The separability
conjunct now reads over `FractionRing (F[Z][X])`, repairing the non-field-separability defect
witnessed by `eq512_strong_separable_unsat`. The remaining open content is the proof itself: the
separable-contraction step is now available over the field `K := FractionRing (F[Z][X])`
(`Irreducible.hasSeparableContraction`), and the per-factor irreducibility/primitivity descends
via Gauss (`IsPrimitive.irreducible_iff_irreducible_map_fraction_map`, as in
`RationalFunctions.lean`); the residual bookkeeping (collecting UFD factors with multiplicities
into the zipped lists and folding the unit into `C`) remains `sorry`. -/

/-- *Strong-separability is unsatisfiable for genuinely-arising factors* — the verified
defect (bug #18) in the separability conjunct of `irreducible_factorization_of_gs_solution`.

The conjunct `∀ Rᵢ ∈ R, Rᵢ.Separable` uses `Polynomial.Separable` over the **coefficient ring**
`F[Z][X]`, which is *not a field*. By `separable_def`, `Rᵢ.Separable` unfolds to a Bézout
identity `a · Rᵢ + b · Rᵢ.derivative = 1` with `a, b : F[Z][X][Y]` — i.e. coprimality *in the
polynomial ring* `F[Z][X][Y]`, an extremely strong condition. It is **not** the paper's intended
separability of `Rᵢ` over the fraction field `F(Z,X)` (equivalently, nonvanishing of `discr_y`,
the form actually consumed by Claim 5.6 `discr_of_irred_components_nonzero`).

Concretely the factor `r = Y² − X` (here `X = C (C X) : F[Z][X][Y]`, a *prime* element of the
coefficient ring) is exactly the kind of irreducible factor a `ModifiedGuruswami` solution
produces: it is irreducible over `F[Z][X]`, squarefree, and **separable over the fraction field**
`F(Z,X)` (its two roots `±√X` are distinct in char ≠ 2). Yet it is **not** `Separable` over
`F[Z][X]`: separability is preserved by every coefficient ring hom (`Separable.map`), so mapping
the coefficient ring `F[Z][X] →+* F` by `Z, X ↦ 0` would send `r` to `Y²`, which is not even
squarefree. Hence no choice of witnesses can satisfy the strong conjunct together with
irreducibility once a factor of `Y`-degree ≥ 2 over a non-square coefficient appears — and the
`ModifiedGuruswami` `Y`-degree budget `D_Y Q < D_X / k` permits exactly such factors. -/

/-- *Separable contraction over the fraction field* — the field-side core of the proof of
`irreducible_factorization_of_gs_solution` (= [BCIKS20, Eq. 5.12]).

For every positive-`Y`-degree irreducible factor `g : F[Z][X][Y]` of a `ModifiedGuruswami`
solution `Q`, its image over the fraction field `K := FractionRing (F[Z][X]) = F(Z,X)` admits a
*separable contraction*: there is a separable `sK : K[Y]` and an exponent `m` with
`expand K (q^m) sK = g.map (algebraMap …)`, where `q` is the exponential characteristic.
Equivalently (`expand_eq_comp_X_pow`), `sK.comp (Y^(q^m))` equals the `K`-image of `g`.

This is the step that genuinely needs a *field*: it composes the exponential-characteristic
transfer `F → F(Z,X)` (`expChar_of_injective_algebraMap` along the injective fraction-field map —
no obstruction, contrary to the earlier OBSTRUCTION note), Gauss's lemma for irreducibility over
the fraction field (`IsPrimitive.irreducible_iff_irreducible_map_fraction_map`, the idiom of
`RationalFunctions.lean`), and Mathlib's separable contraction over a field
(`Irreducible.hasSeparableContraction`). The remaining open content of Eq. 5.12 is the *descent*
of this `K`-side contraction back to a primitive separable factor over `F[Z][X]` (a Gauss /
`integerNormalization` content argument with no direct Mathlib transfer lemma), plus the
multiplicity bookkeeping that assembles the factors into the zipped `(R, f, e)` lists. -/

/-- *Descent of the field-side separable contraction back to the UFD `R[X]`* — the first of the
two pieces of [BCIKS20, Eq. 5.12] flagged as remaining. Given an irreducible primitive `g : R[X]`
(`R` a UFD with fraction field `K`) and a `K`-side separable contraction
`expand K n sK = g.map (algebraMap R K)` (`n ≥ 1`, e.g. `n = q^m` from
`eq512_separable_contraction_over_fraction_field`), there is a primitive irreducible `r : R[X]`
whose `K`-image is separable, and an `R`-unit `u`, with `g = C u * expand R n r`.

The witness is `r := (integerNormalization R⁰ sK).primPart`. Clearing denominators
(`IsLocalization.integerNormalization_spec`) and splitting off the content
(`eq_C_content_mul_primPart`) shows `r.map (algebraMap R K) = C c * sK` with `c` a `K`-unit; this
gives separability of the `K`-image (`Separable.unit_mul`). Applying `expand K n` and using
`map_expand` yields `(expand R n r).map = C c * g.map`, so the primitive polynomials `expand R n r`
and `g` have associated `K`-images, hence are associated in `R[X]` (Gauss's
`IsPrimitive.dvd_iff_fraction_map_dvd_fraction_map`, both directions). The associating unit is `C u`
with `u` an `R`-unit (`Polynomial.isUnit_iff`), and `r` is irreducible because `expand R n r` is
