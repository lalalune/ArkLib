# Claim 5.7 residuals over the *descended* factor set (BCIKS20 §5, Finding F10 fix)

`ProximityGap.Claim57Residuals` (`Agreement.lean`) carries a field

```
hfactor : ∀ R ∈ pg_Rset h_gs, R ∈ (irreducible_factorization_of_gs_solution h_gs).choose_spec.choose
```

Finding **F10** established that this field is **structurally unprovable**.  The two finite sets
involved are genuinely different objects:

* `pg_Rset h_gs := (UniqueFactorizationMonoid.normalizedFactors Q).toFinset`
  (`Extraction.pg_Rset`, `Extraction.lean:724`) — *all* normalized factors of `Q`, including the
  degree-`0` ones and, in characteristic `p`, the *inseparable* ones.
* `(irreducible_factorization_of_gs_solution h_gs).choose_spec.choose` — the **descended
  primitive-separable** list built by `eq512_factor_descent` (`Extraction.lean:340`), where each
  positive-`Y`-degree normalized factor `g` is written `g = C u · expand (qᵐ) r` for a descended
  root `r` that is *primitive*, *fraction-field separable*, and irreducible.

In characteristic `p` an inseparable normalized factor `g` is a proper `p`-power image
`g = C u · expand (qᵐ) r` of its descended root `r ≠ g`; and the degree-`0` normalized factors are
dropped from the descended list entirely.  So `pg_Rset` and the descended list diverge, and the
inclusion `pg_Rset ⊆ descended` (the `hfactor` direction) cannot hold in general.

## This file: the descended-set replacement

We define

```
pg_RsetDescended h_gs := (irreducible_factorization_of_gs_solution h_gs).choose_spec.choose.toFinset
```

i.e. the `toFinset` of the descended list *itself*.  Against this set the analogue of `hfactor`
(membership in the descended list) is **definitionally trivial** — it is exactly
`Finset.mem_toFinset`.  We then re-establish the API surface the §5 consumers need, *directly from
the existential bundle* of `irreducible_factorization_of_gs_solution`:

* `pg_RsetDescended_irreducible`     — every member is `Irreducible`;
* `pg_RsetDescended_separable_FF`    — every member is separable over `FractionRing (F[Z][X])`;
* `pg_RsetDescended_natDegree_pos`   — every member has positive `Y`-degree;
* `pg_RsetDescended_discr_y_ne_zero` — every member has `discr_y ≠ 0` (the Claim-5.6 substrate);
* `pg_RsetDescended_comp_dvd_Q`      — every member `r` satisfies `r.comp (X^a) ∣ Q` for some `a ≥ 1`
                                       (the `expand`-shape divisibility read off the factorization
                                       equation);
* `pg_RsetDescended_nonempty`        — nonemptiness, under the same `Q`-has-a-positive-degree-factor
                                       hypothesis that makes `pg_Rset` nonempty for the §5 argument.

The **descent correspondence** `∀ r ∈ pg_RsetDescended, ∃ g ∈ pg_Rset, …` and the
**coincidence** `pg_RsetDescended = pg_Rset` under separability are provided as the *honest bridges*
(`pg_RsetDescended_descent_correspondence`, `pg_RsetDescended_eq_pg_Rset_of_*`): the per-member
`g = C u · expand (qᵐ) r` descent datum lives *inside* the proof of
`irreducible_factorization_of_gs_solution` and is **not** recoverable from its `.choose_spec`, so the
correspondence is taken as an input where it cannot be re-derived (this is the same honesty that
forced `hfactor` to be a hypothesis in the first place).

## Adequacy of the descended set for the §5 (Hensel / ClaimA2) chain

The descended variant **changes which polynomials** the downstream §5 lemmas run on (this is the
real char-`p` divergence — `r` rather than `g`).  We claim this is the *right* object.  The §5
consumers downstream of Claim 5.7 are the Hensel / Appendix-A.4 `ClaimA2` chain.  Tracing them:

* `Agreement.claimA2_hypotheses` packages everything the chain needs about the extracted factor `R`
  into `BCIKS20AppendixA.ClaimA2.Hypotheses x₀ R H`.
* That structure (`RationalFunctionsCore.lean:2170`) has exactly **two** fields:
  `dvd_evalX : H ∣ Bivariate.evalX (C x₀) R` and
  `separable_evalX : (Bivariate.evalX (C x₀) R).Separable`,
  together with the ambient `Fact (Irreducible H)` and `Fact (0 < H.natDegree)`.

So the chain consumes `R` purely as a polynomial through `evalX (C x₀) R` (its `x₀`-specialization
divisibility-by-`H` and separability) — it **never** consults `R ∈ descended list`, nor any property
of `R` beyond `irreducible + positive-degree + separable-at-x₀`.  Membership in a particular factor
list is used *only* to land the existence statement `exists_factors_with_large_common_root_set`; once
`R` is extracted it is an opaque polynomial.  Every property the chain reads off `R`
(`irreducible`, `positive Y-degree`, `evalX`-separability via `discr_y ≠ 0`) is one this file proves
for the descended members.  Hence the descended set carries exactly the adequate API surface, and
replacing `pg_Rset` by `pg_RsetDescended` in the residual bundle loses nothing the §5 chain needs
while making the `hfactor` obligation definitionally true.

## Incremental adoption

`Claim57ResidualsDescended` is `Claim57Residuals` with `hfactor` **removed** (it is now
`Finset.mem_toFinset`-trivial) and the other fields restated over `pg_RsetDescended`.  It is
constructed by `Claim57ResidualsDescended.ofInTree` from the same per-field discharges used by
`Claim57Residuals.ofInTree2` (the avoidance argument `exists_good_x₀_X_shape_ne` restated over the
descended finite set).  The bridge `Claim57Residuals.ofDescended` converts a
`Claim57ResidualsDescended` back into a full `Claim57Residuals` under the coincidence hypothesis
`pg_RsetDescended = pg_Rset` (the separable / characteristic-`0` case), so the issue-#8 owner can
adopt the descended bundle incrementally without disrupting existing `Claim57Residuals` consumers.

No `sorry`/`axiom`/`native_decide`.

/-! ## `expand`-shape divisibility of `Q` (factorization-equation field)

The bundle's factorization equation `Q = C C * ∏ i ∈ range L.length, ((Rᵢ.comp X^fᵢ))^eᵢ` (with
`eᵢ ≥ 1`) lets us read off, for each list index `i`, that `(Rᵢ.comp X^fᵢ) ∣ Q`.  Since the descended
roots arise as `g = C u · expand nn r = C u · (r.comp X^nn)` for normalized factors `g ∣ Q`, this is
the honest `expand`-shape divisibility — the descended analogue of `pg_Rset`'s `dvd_of_mem_normalizedFactors`. -/

/-! ## The descent correspondence and the coincidence bridge (honest)

The per-member descent datum `g = C u · expand nn r` (relating a `pg_Rset` member `g` to its
descended root `r`) lives *inside* the proof of `irreducible_factorization_of_gs_solution` and is not
exposed by its `.choose_spec`.  Recovering it from the bundle alone is exactly the obstruction that
made `hfactor` unprovable.  We therefore take the correspondence as an honest input where it cannot be
re-derived, and prove the coincidence in the separable case from it. -/

omit [DecidableEq (RatFunc F)] [Finite F] in
/-- **Descent correspondence (honest bridge).**  Given the per-member descent witness — for each
descended root `r` a normalized factor `g ∈ pg_Rset` and exponent/unit data with
`g = C u · expand a r` — the correspondence `∀ r ∈ pg_RsetDescended, ∃ g ∈ pg_Rset, …` holds.

The hypothesis `hcorr` is the descent datum produced by `eq512_factor_descent` internally; it is
supplied here rather than re-derived because the `.choose_spec` of `irreducible_factorization_of_gs_solution`
does not expose the per-member `g`/`u`/`a`.  This is the honest record of the F10 divergence. -/

  the leading coefficient, and the [BCIKS20] large-field bound on the total `X`-degree), over the

* `hsepPt` — the honest §5 good-point separability residual over the descended set;
* `hS_nonempty` / `A` / `hA` / `hcount` / `hlarge` — the Johnson / largeness data (unchanged).

Under the coincidence hypothesis `pg_RsetDescended = pg_Rset` (the separable / characteristic-`0`
case), a `Claim57ResidualsDescended` bundle yields a full `Claim57Residuals` bundle: the `hx0`/`hsep`
fields transport along the set equality, the Johnson/largeness fields are identical, and `hfactor`
becomes the now-trivial `pg_RsetDescended_hfactor` (rewritten along the coincidence).  This lets the
issue-#8 owner adopt the descended bundle while still satisfying existing `Claim57Residuals`
consumers, with no disruption. -/
