# Round 11 (Issue #232, ABF26) — the additive-energy TOWER of `F₁₇`: `E(G)/|G|²` crosses the
# char-0 minimum as the subgroup grows.

`SubgroupAdditiveEnergyF17` computed `E(G) = 264` for the order-8 subgroup. This file computes the
**exact additive energy of every subgroup in the `F₁₇^×` 2-power tower** (orders `2,4,8,16`) and
isolates the **crossover**: the char-0 minimal-energy bound `E(G) ≤ 3|G|²` (true for complex roots of
unity) **holds for the small subgroups and fails for the large ones**, with the crossover between
order 4 and order 8:

| order `|G|` | `E(G)` | `3|G|²` | `E(G)/|G|²` | char-0 bound `E ≤ 3|G|²`? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2  | 6    | 12  | 1.50  | ✓ holds |
| 4  | 36   | 48  | 2.25  | ✓ holds |
| 8  | 264  | 192 | 4.125 | ✗ fails |
| 16 | 3856 | 768 | 15.06 | ✗ fails (`= F₁₇^×`, energy `≈ |G|³/p`) |

The ratio `E(G)/|G|²` is monotone increasing up the tower — concrete evidence that the finite-field
additive energy of a multiplicative subgroup grows (toward concentration) as `|G|` approaches `q`,
exactly the `|G|`-vs-`q` dependence the prize question turns on. All `decide`, `sorry`-free,
axiom-clean.
