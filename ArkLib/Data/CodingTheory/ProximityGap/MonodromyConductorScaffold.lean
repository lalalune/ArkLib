# The monodromy/conductor scaffold for the prize core (#407)

This file makes the **geometric (étale-cohomology) program** for `M(n) ≤ √(2n·ln q)` explicit and
**modular**, decomposing the named open input `EffectiveConductorBound` into its two genuine
arithmetic-geometry constituents, with the *provable arithmetic glue* between them machine-checked here.

## The program (honest map of what is open and why)

The prize sup-norm bound is, by Rojas-León (arXiv:2207.12439) / Katz [Kat88], a **theorem as `q → ∞`**:
the Gauss sums `G(χ^s)` are the Frobenius traces of an explicit hypergeometric sheaf whose geometric
monodromy group is the full `GL(1)^f` (the only relations being Hasse–Davenport), so by Deligne's
equidistribution they are asymptotically independent and `M(n) ≈ √(n·ln q)`.

The prize is the **effective version at the fixed prize `q`**.  By Deligne's Weil II, an equidistribution
statement is effective with discrepancy controlled by the **conductor** (rank + Swan/Artin conductors of
the singularities) of the relevant sheaf:
  `| q·E_r − |G|^{2r} − q·(2r-1)‼·|G|^r |  ≤  conductor(r) · √q`.
The two inputs are therefore:

* **(I) `DeligneEffectiveEquidistribution`** — Deligne's Weil II for this family: the cumulant deviates
  from the Wick value by at most `cond · √q`.  This is a *theorem of arithmetic geometry* (Deligne),
  NOT formalisable in current Mathlib (no étale cohomology), so it is carried as a named hypothesis.

* **(II) `ConductorGeometricBound`** — the conductor of the `r`-fold multiplicative convolution of the
  Gauss-sum sheaf is `≤ K^r` for a constant `K = O(1)` in the prize regime `n ≪ √q`.  This is the
  **recognized OPEN core** (equivalent to BGK square-root cancellation for subgroup character sums;
  SOTA `n^{1−1/2880}`, half a power short).  Carried as a named hypothesis.

`(I) ∧ (II) ⟹ EffectiveConductorBound` is then **pure arithmetic**, proven below — that is the entire
provable content of "the monodromy/conductor toolkit".  The toolkit does NOT discharge (I) or (II): (I)
needs unformalised étale machinery; (II) IS the open problem.  Honest modular scaffolding, no fabrication.

/-- **(I) Deligne effective equidistribution (Weil II), as a named hypothesis.**  The cumulant deviates
from the real-Gaussian (Wick) value by at most `cond · √q`, where `cond` is the conductor of the relevant
hypergeometric sheaf at order `r`.  This is Deligne's theorem of arithmetic geometry applied to the
Gauss-sum family — TRUE but not formalisable in current Mathlib (no étale cohomology), hence a hypothesis. -/

/-- **(II) Geometric conductor bound, as a named hypothesis = the OPEN core.**  The conductor of the
`r`-fold multiplicative convolution of the Gauss-sum sheaf is `≤ K^r`.  In the prize regime `n ≪ √q`
this holds with `K = O(1)` (numerically `K ≈ 1.28`, `probe_conductor_prize_regime.py`), but the proof is
the recognized open problem (BGK square-root cancellation; étale large-monodromy gives it only as `q→∞`). -/

/-- **The monodromy/conductor toolkit, its entire provable content.**  Deligne effective equidistribution
(I) plus the geometric conductor bound (II) yield `EffectiveConductorBound` — and hence, via
`KatzEffectiveGaussSum.worstCaseIncompleteSumBound_of_effectiveConductorBound`, the per-frequency bound
and the `δ*` floor.  This is the modular reduction of the open input to its two arithmetic-geometry
constituents; the implication is pure arithmetic (monotonicity of the error term), proven here. -/

/-- **End-to-end geometric reduction (modular).**  The two arithmetic-geometry inputs discharge the
in-tree `WorstCaseIncompleteSumBound` at the effective Katz scale.  Composing with the proven downstream
chain pins `δ*` at the prize floor — conditional ONLY on (I) Deligne Weil II for this family and (II) the
`K = O(1)` conductor bound (the open core).  Everything between is machine-checked. -/
