# A structural NO-GO: the list-decoding face is WEAKER than the MCA face (#407)

The Proximity Prize has two grand-challenge faces over the same Reed–Solomon code:

* **the list-decoding (LD) face** — for a single received word `w`, count the codewords of
  `C` agreeing with `w` on at least `a` coordinates (`singleWordList`); and
* **the mutual-correlated-agreement (MCA) face** — for an affine *pencil*
  `{f + γ·g : γ ∈ F}`, count the codewords agreeing with *some point of the pencil* on at
  least `a` coordinates (`pencilIncidence`), the engine behind the bad-scalar count
  (`mcaBadCount`) and hence `δ*_MCA`.

The honest, unconditional content of this file is the **domination**

> `singleWordList C w a  ⊆  pencilIncidence C w g a`   (any direction `g`),

because the base word `w` is itself the point of the pencil at `γ = 0`. Taking cardinalities,

> `#singleWordList C w a  ≤  #pencilIncidence C w g a`,

so the worst-case far-line incidence dominates the single-word list size. Consequently the
threshold of the *line* problem is **at least** the threshold of the *single-word* problem:
the radius at which the pencil incidence exceeds a budget is no larger than the radius at
which the single-word list exceeds it, i.e. the LD face is the *weaker* of the two:

> `δ*_LD ≥ δ*_MCA`   (`mca_radius_le_ld_radius`).

**Why this is a NO-GO, not a closure.** It says a *line passes near at least as many
codewords as a single point*. So an LD list-size bound `#singleWordList ≤ B` does **not**
bound the MCA incidence: a single-word bound is on the *smaller* quantity. We exhibit a
machine-checked toy instance where the inequality is **strict** (a far direction makes the
pencil touch a codeword the base point misses) — proving an LD bound alone genuinely cannot
pin the (harder) MCA `δ*`. Nothing here closes the prize core; it isolates which face is
harder. Issue #407.

/-- **MCA face.** The pencil incidence of code `C` against the affine line through `f` in
direction `g` at agreement threshold `a`: the codewords agreeing with *some* point of the
pencil on at least `a` coordinates. This is the codeword-side engine for the bad-scalar

/-! ## The domination: LD ⊆ MCA -/

/-- **The structural domination (set form).** For ANY direction `g`, the single-word list of
the base word `f` is contained in the pencil incidence along `{f + γ·g}`: every codeword
agreeing with `f` on `≥ a` points agrees with the pencil point at `γ = 0` (which *is* `f`).
The line passes near everything the point does. -/

/-- **The structural domination (cardinality form).** The worst-case far-line incidence
dominates the single-word list size: `#singleWordList ≤ #pencilIncidence`, for any direction.
This is the precise sense in which the LD face is the *weaker* of the two grand challenges. -/

/-- Even taking the *best* direction for the LD side, the worst-case incidence over all
directions still dominates: the maximum over `g` of the pencil incidence is at least the
single-word list of `f`. (Trivial corollary, recorded because it is the form a `δ*`
comparison consumes — the MCA quantity is a sup over pencils.) -/

/-! ## The threshold consequence: `δ*_LD ≥ δ*_MCA`

We phrase the threshold abstractly. Fix a budget `B` (the prize budget is `q·ε* ≈ n`). The
*bad radii* for a face are the agreement thresholds `a` at which that face's count exceeds
`B`. Since agreement `a` and proximity radius `δ = 1 − a/n` move oppositely, a *larger* set
of bad agreement-thresholds means a *smaller* `δ*` (the supremum of good radii). The
domination gives: every `a` bad for the LD face is bad for the MCA face. So the MCA bad-set
is larger ⇒ `δ*_MCA ≤ δ*_LD`. -/

/-- If the single-word list at threshold `a` exceeds the budget `B`, so does the pencil
incidence (in any direction): bad-for-LD ⇒ bad-for-MCA at the same agreement threshold. -/

    B < (pencilIncidence C f g a).card :=
  lt_of_lt_of_le hbad (singleWordList_card_le_pencilIncidence_card C f g a)

/-- **The NO-GO at the threshold level.** Read `goodA` as the agreement thresholds whose
face-count stays within budget `B`; `δ*` is governed by the *largest* good `a` (i.e. the
smallest agreement = largest radius that is still safe). The MCA good-set is a *subset* of
the LD good-set, hence the MCA threshold cannot exceed the LD threshold.

Concretely: `{a | #pencilIncidence ≤ B} ⊆ {a | #singleWordList ≤ B}`. An agreement
threshold safe for the line is automatically safe for the point — but not conversely. So a
bound on the single-word list (LD) can certify *more* agreement thresholds as safe than are
actually safe for the line (MCA): the LD face is strictly more permissive. -/

/-- The numeric reading of the no-go: `δ*` is `1 − a*/n` where `a*` is the *least* safe
agreement threshold. Since the MCA face's least-safe `a` is `≥` the LD face's (the MCA
good-agreement set sits inside the LD one), `δ*_MCA ≤ δ*_LD`. Recorded as the comparison of
minima of the two good-agreement sets. -/

/-! ## A machine-checked instance where the domination is STRICT

A far direction makes the pencil touch a codeword the base point misses, so the single-word
list strictly undercounts the pencil incidence. This is the witness that an LD bound is on a
*strictly smaller* quantity — it genuinely cannot pin the MCA count. -/
