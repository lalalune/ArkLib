# Hab25 core: from collinearity to correlated agreement (Lemma 1, [AHIV17/BKS18])

This file ports the elementary, lossless counting bound that is the *final step* of every
correlated-agreement theorem in the [BCIKS20]/[GKL24]/[Zei24]/[BCH+25] line of work, and is
restated and reused verbatim in

  Ulrich Haböck, "A note on mutual correlated agreement for Reed–Solomon codes",
  ePrint 2025/2110 (Nov 17, 2025), **Section 2, Lemma 1** ([AHIV17, BKS18]),

(local fulltext: `research/proximity-prize/artifacts/2025-2110-fulltext.txt`, lines 86–115).

## Paper statement (Hab25 Lemma 1)

> Given an arbitrary linear code `C` over a domain `D`, and functions `f₀, f₁ : D → F_q`.
> Fix `γ ∈ (0,1)`, and assume two codewords `p₀, p₁ ∈ C` such that
> `Δ(p₀ + z·p₁, f₀ + z·f₁) ≤ γ` for all `z` in a set `S ⊆ F_q`. Then, if
> `|S| > ⌈γ·n⌉ + 1`, it holds that `Δ([p₀,p₁], [f₀,f₁]) ≤ γ`.

The proof (paper, lines 101–114) is a double-count / contradiction:
* assume the *interleaved* disagreement set `E = {x : (p₀ x, p₁ x) ≠ (f₀ x, f₁ x)}` has more
  than `e := ⌈γ·n⌉` elements, so it contains a subset `E'` of size `e + 1`;
* for each `z ∈ S`, since `Δ(p_z, f_z) ≤ e/n`, the fold `p_z := p₀ + z·p₁` agrees with
  `f_z := f₀ + z·f₁` on at least `n − e` of the `n` points, hence **at least one** point of
  `E'` (a set of size `e + 1`) is matched by `z`;
* but each point `x ∈ E` is matched by **at most one** `z`, because the gap
  `c_z(x) − f_z(x) = (p₀ − f₀)(x) + z·(p₁ − f₁)(x)` is a *non-trivial* affine functional in
  `z` (its constant or linear coefficient is nonzero, as `(p₀,p₁)(x) ≠ (f₀,f₁)(x)`), so it
  has at most one root;
* double counting matches over `S × E'` gives `|S| ≤ |E'| = e + 1`, contradicting `|S| > e+1`.

## What is in this file (all genuinely proven, no `sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`)

* `affine_root_subsingleton` — the per-coordinate pivot: a non-trivial affine functional
  `z ↦ d₀ + z·d₁` over a field has at most one root. This is the "each point has at most one
  matching `z`" sentence of Hab25's proof, isolated and proven via `Polynomial`.
* `affine_match_card_le_one` — its `Finset` form: `|{z ∈ S : d₀ + z·d₁ = 0}| ≤ 1` for a
  non-trivial `(d₀,d₁)`.
* `hab25_lemma1_counting` — the **full Lemma 1**, stated and proven over an abstract finite
  domain `ι` (= `D`) and parameter index for `S ⊆ F`, in its sharp integer (`e`-point) form:
  if `|S| > e + 1` and every `z ∈ S` folds to a function matching `(f₀,f₁)`'s fold on
  `≥ n − e` points, then the interleaved disagreement set has size `≤ e`.

The endgame of Hab25's main theorem (`Claim 1`, paper lines 302–310: "From the proof of
Lemma 1 we understand that the number of scalars which improve agreement beyond `A°` is
bounded by `|D \ A°| ≤ n`") reuses *exactly* `affine_match_card_le_one` summed over
coordinates. So this file is the reusable combinatorial bedrock of the whole Hab25 proof.

## What this file deliberately does NOT do

The full main theorem (MCA up to the Johnson radius `1 − √ρ`) additionally needs the
Guruswami–Sudan bivariate interpolation analysis of `f₀ + Z·f₁` over `F(Z)` (Hab25 §3,
generalizing [BCIKS20] §5): the degree bounds `D_Y < ℓ`, `D_X < ℓρn`, `D_{YZ} ≤ ℓ³ρn/6`,
the discriminant non-vanishing, the Hensel lift, and the irreducible-factor decomposition
`E = ⋃ E_{i,j}` with `|E_{i,j}| ≤ ℓ⁶(ρn)²/3`. Those are NOT in this file (they are the
`DEEP` nodes of the dependency tree). This file proves the one node that Hab25 itself shares
with the elementary tradition and reuses at the very end. See the disposition note
`research/proximity-prize/dispositions/pc-w5-hab25.md` for the full tree and classification.

/-! ## Hab25 Lemma 1 (full statement), proven by the paper's double count

We model the paper's quantities abstractly:
* `ι` is the domain `D`, `n := |ι|`;
* `d₀ d₁ : ι → F` are the *difference* functions `p₀ − f₀` and `p₁ − f₁` (working with the
  differences is WLOG and removes the linear-code hypothesis from the statement: the affine
  functional at coordinate `x` is `g_x(z) = d₀ x + z · d₁ x`, and the interleaved
  disagreement set is `E = {x : d₀ x ≠ 0 ∨ d₁ x ≠ 0}`);
* `S : Finset F` is the scalar set;
* `e : ℕ` is `⌈γ·n⌉` (the integer agreement budget), and the per-`z` hypothesis
  `hagree` says each fold matches on `≥ n − e` points (equivalently misses `≤ e` points).

The conclusion is the interleaved disagreement bound `|E| ≤ e`, i.e.
`Δ([p₀,p₁],[f₀,f₁]) ≤ e/n = γ`, matching the paper's claim. -/

/-- **Hab25 Lemma 1 ([AHIV17, BKS18]), sharp integer form.**

Let `ι` be the domain (`n := |ι|`), `d₀ d₁ : ι → F` the row differences, `S : Finset F` the
scalar set, and `e : ℕ` the agreement budget `⌈γ·n⌉`. Suppose

* `(hagree)` for every `z ∈ S`, the fold `affineGap d₀ d₁ z` is zero on at least `n − e`
  coordinates — equivalently it is **nonzero on at most `e`** coordinates, i.e.
  `Δ(p_z, f_z) ≤ e/n = γ`;
* `(hS)` `|S| > e + 1`.

Then the interleaved disagreement set has `|E| ≤ e`, i.e. `Δ([p₀,p₁],[f₀,f₁]) ≤ e/n = γ`.

This is proven exactly as in the paper: by contradiction via a `S × E'` double count, using
`affine_match_card_le_one` for the per-coordinate "≤ 1 matching `z`" bound. -/
