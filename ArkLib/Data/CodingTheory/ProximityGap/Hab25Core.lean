# Hab25 core: from collinearity to correlated agreement (Lemma 1, [AHIV17/BKS18])

This file ports the elementary, lossless counting bound that is the *final step* of every
correlated-agreement theorem in the [BCIKS20]/[GKL24]/[Zei24]/[BCH+25] line of work, and is
restated and reused verbatim in

  Ulrich Haböck, "A note on mutual correlated agreement for Reed–Solomon codes",
  ePrint 2025/2110 (Nov 17, 2025), **Section 2, Lemma 1** ([AHIV17, BKS18]),

(local fulltext: `research/proximity-prize/artifacts/2025-2110-fulltext.txt`, lines 86–115).

## Paper statement (Hab25 Lemma 1)

> Given an arbitrary linear code `C` over a domain `D`, and functions `f₀, f₁ : D → F_q`.
> Fix `γ ∈ (0,1)`, and assume two codewords `p₀, p₁ ∈ C` such that
> `Δ(p₀ + z·p₁, f₀ + z·f₁) ≤ γ` for all `z` in a set `S ⊆ F_q`. Then, if
> `|S| > ⌈γ·n⌉ + 1`, it holds that `Δ([p₀,p₁], [f₀,f₁]) ≤ γ`.

The proof (paper, lines 101–114) is a double-count / contradiction:
* assume the *interleaved* disagreement set `E = {x : (p₀ x, p₁ x) ≠ (f₀ x, f₁ x)}` has more
  than `e := ⌈γ·n⌉` elements, so it contains a subset `E'` of size `e + 1`;
* for each `z ∈ S`, since `Δ(p_z, f_z) ≤ e/n`, the fold `p_z := p₀ + z·p₁` agrees with
  `f_z := f₀ + z·f₁` on at least `n − e` of the `n` points, hence **at least one** point of
  `E'` (a set of size `e + 1`) is matched by `z`;
* but each point `x ∈ E` is matched by **at most one** `z`, because the gap
  `c_z(x) − f_z(x) = (p₀ − f₀)(x) + z·(p₁ − f₁)(x)` is a *non-trivial* affine functional in
  `z` (its constant or linear coefficient is nonzero, as `(p₀,p₁)(x) ≠ (f₀,f₁)(x)`), so it
  has at most one root;
* double counting matches over `S × E'` gives `|S| ≤ |E'| = e + 1`, contradicting `|S| > e+1`.

## What is in this file (all genuinely proven, no `sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`)

* `affine_root_subsingleton` — the per-coordinate pivot: a non-trivial affine functional
  `z ↦ d₀ + z·d₁` over a field has at most one root. This is the "each point has at most one
  matching `z`" sentence of Hab25's proof, isolated and proven via `Polynomial`.
* `affine_match_card_le_one` — its `Finset` form: `|{z ∈ S : d₀ + z·d₁ = 0}| ≤ 1` for a
  non-trivial `(d₀,d₁)`.
* `hab25_lemma1_counting` — the **full Lemma 1**, stated and proven over an abstract finite
  domain `ι` (= `D`) and parameter index for `S ⊆ F`, in its sharp integer (`e`-point) form:
  if `|S| > e + 1` and every `z ∈ S` folds to a function matching `(f₀,f₁)`'s fold on
  `≥ n − e` points, then the interleaved disagreement set has size `≤ e`.

The endgame of Hab25's main theorem (`Claim 1`, paper lines 302–310: "From the proof of
Lemma 1 we understand that the number of scalars which improve agreement beyond `A°` is
bounded by `|D \ A°| ≤ n`") reuses *exactly* `affine_match_card_le_one` summed over
coordinates. So this file is the reusable combinatorial bedrock of the whole Hab25 proof.

## What this file deliberately does NOT do

The full main theorem (MCA up to the Johnson radius `1 − √ρ`) additionally needs the
Guruswami–Sudan bivariate interpolation analysis of `f₀ + Z·f₁` over `F(Z)` (Hab25 §3,
generalizing [BCIKS20] §5): the degree bounds `D_Y < ℓ`, `D_X < ℓρn`, `D_{YZ} ≤ ℓ³ρn/6`,
the discriminant non-vanishing, the Hensel lift, and the irreducible-factor decomposition
`E = ⋃ E_{i,j}` with `|E_{i,j}| ≤ ℓ⁶(ρn)²/3`. Those are NOT in this file (they are the
`DEEP` nodes of the dependency tree). This file proves the one node that Hab25 itself shares
with the elementary tradition and reuses at the very end. See the disposition note
`research/proximity-prize/dispositions/pc-w5-hab25.md` for the full tree and classification.

/-! ## Hab25 Lemma 1 (full statement), proven by the paper's double count

We model the paper's quantities abstractly:
* `ι` is the domain `D`, `n := |ι|`;
* `d₀ d₁ : ι → F` are the *difference* functions `p₀ − f₀` and `p₁ − f₁` (working with the
  differences is WLOG and removes the linear-code hypothesis from the statement: the affine
  functional at coordinate `x` is `g_x(z) = d₀ x + z · d₁ x`, and the interleaved
  disagreement set is `E = {x : d₀ x ≠ 0 ∨ d₁ x ≠ 0}`);
* `S : Finset F` is the scalar set;
* `e : ℕ` is `⌈γ·n⌉` (the integer agreement budget), and the per-`z` hypothesis
  `hagree` says each fold matches on `≥ n − e` points (equivalently misses `≤ e` points).

The conclusion is the interleaved disagreement bound `|E| ≤ e`, i.e.
`Δ([p₀,p₁],[f₀,f₁]) ≤ e/n = γ`, matching the paper's claim. -/

/-- **Hab25 Lemma 1 ([AHIV17, BKS18]), sharp integer form.**

Let `ι` be the domain (`n := |ι|`), `d₀ d₁ : ι → F` the row differences, `S : Finset F` the
scalar set, and `e : ℕ` the agreement budget `⌈γ·n⌉`. Suppose

* `(hagree)` for every `z ∈ S`, the fold `affineGap d₀ d₁ z` is zero on at least `n − e`
  coordinates — equivalently it is **nonzero on at most `e`** coordinates, i.e.
  `Δ(p_z, f_z) ≤ e/n = γ`;
* `(hS)` `|S| > e + 1`.

Then the interleaved disagreement set has `|E| ≤ e`, i.e. `Δ([p₀,p₁],[f₀,f₁]) ≤ e/n = γ`.

This is proven exactly as in the paper: by contradiction via a `S × E'` double count, using
`affine_match_card_le_one` for the per-coordinate "≤ 1 matching `z`" bound. -/

/-! ## Hab25 main theorem: Johnson-radius MCA for smooth-domain Reed–Solomon codes

This section assembles the *statement* of Haböck 2025/2110's main theorem in the in-tree
`ε_mca` vocabulary, a **proven** end-to-end reduction `main-bound ⟸ residuals`, and a
**proven** bridge from that bound to the Grand-MCA `MCALowerWitness` at the Johnson radius.

### Paper theorem mapped (Hab25 §3, main theorem; cf. [BCHKS25 Thm 4.6], ABF26 Thm 4.12)

For a Reed–Solomon code `C := RS[F, L, k]` over a *smooth* evaluation domain `L` (`n := |L|`,
rate `ρ := k/n`), and any slack `η > 0`, writing `ρ₊ := ρ + 1/n` and the multiplicity
`m := max(⌈√ρ₊/(2η)⌉, 3)`, for every proximity radius `δ` strictly inside the Johnson range
`δ < 1 − √ρ₊ − η` the mutual correlated-agreement error is bounded by

  `ε_mca(C, δ) ≤ (1/|F|) · ( (2(m+½)⁵ + 3(m+½)·δ·ρ₊) / (3·ρ₊^{3/2}) · n  +  (m+½)/√ρ₊ )`.

This is *exactly* the closed form already recorded in-tree as
`CodingTheory.rs_epsMCA_johnson_range_bchks25` (`CapacityBounds.lean`), which the
`GrandChallenges` bridge `MCALowerWitness.ofJohnsonBCHKS25` consumes. ABF26 Theorem 4.12
cites **[Hab25]** alongside [BCHKS25] for this bound (Hab25 improves the constants /
parameter regime; the asymptotic shape is the one stated above). We therefore phrase the
Hab25 main bound against that very RHS so that the proven bridge lands directly on the
in-tree `MCALowerWitness.ofJohnsonBCHKS25` input shape.

### Proof skeleton of Hab25 §3 and its decomposition into proven vs residual

Hab25 derives the bound by generalising the Guruswami–Sudan bivariate analysis of
[BCIKS20 §5] to the *mutual* setting. The skeleton, with its in-tree disposition, is:

1. **(BCIKS20 CA input — `Hab25CAInput`, residual hypothesis.)** The interleaved fold
   `f₀ + Z·f₁` over the rational function field `F(Z)` is `δ`-close to `C` for a
   `(1−ε_ca)` fraction of lines. This is the [BCIKS20] correlated-agreement statement; the
   in-tree chain lives under `BCIKS20/ListDecoding/Agreement.lean` (owned by a live external
   session, hence consumed here as a hypothesis pointing at that chain rather than re-proved).

2. **(GS bivariate degree/Hensel/factor analysis — `Hab25GSInterpolation`, DEEP residual.)**
   The per-pair lift of CA to MCA in the Johnson regime: build the Guruswami–Sudan
   interpolation polynomial `Q(X, Y)` of `f₀ + Z·f₁` with degree bounds `D_Y < ℓ`,
   `D_X < ℓρn`, `D_{YZ} ≤ ℓ³ρn/6`; show the discriminant is non-vanishing; Hensel-lift the
   factorisation; and decompose the *mutual* disagreement set `E = ⋃_{i,j} E_{i,j}` into
   irreducible-factor pieces with `|E_{i,j}| ≤ ℓ⁶(ρn)²/3`, summing to the `1/|F|`-scaled
   polynomial error above. These are the genuinely deep nodes (the `DEEP` class of the
   dependency tree); we name them as a residual `Prop` whose conclusion is *precisely* the
   numeric `ε_mca` bound, with no `sorry`/`axiom`.

3. **(Per-coordinate pivot — PROVEN, this file.)** The endgame counting ("at most one scalar
   improves agreement at any disagreement coordinate", Hab25 Claim 1, paper lines 302–310)
   is `affine_match_card_le_one` / `hab25_endgame_count`, already proven above and reused
   verbatim by both [BCIKS20] and Hab25 at the very end of the argument.

The honest decomposition is therefore: step 3 (and the elementary Lemma 1 counting) is
**proven** in this file; steps 1–2 are **named residual `Prop`s**; and the reduction
"`Hab25GSInterpolation` ⟹ main `ε_mca` bound ⟹ `MCALowerWitness`" is **proven** below, so
that *when the residuals are discharged the Grand-MCA lower witness at the Johnson radius
follows mechanically*. -/

For a smooth-domain Reed–Solomon code, slack `η > 0`, and radius `δ` in the Johnson range
`δ < 1 − √ρ₊ − η`, the mutual correlated-agreement error obeys

  `ε_mca(RS[F, L, k], δ) ≤ johnsonBoundReal`.

**Proven reduction.** This is the proven `main-bound ⟸ residuals` edge: it follows directly
from the Step-2 residual `Hab25GSInterpolation`. The Step-1 CA residual `Hab25CAInput` is the
input the paper's §3 analysis *consumes* to produce `Hab25GSInterpolation`; we expose it as a
hypothesis so the dependency on the [BCIKS20] chain is explicit, even though the final numeric
edge is carried by the GS residual. When both residuals are discharged in-tree the bound holds
unconditionally. -/

/-- **Proven bridge: Hab25 main bound ⟹ Grand-MCA `MCALowerWitness`.**

Given the Hab25 residuals (Step-1 CA input + Step-2 GS interpolation), the Johnson-range side
condition, `δ ≤ 1`, and the Phase-5 numeric check `johnsonBoundReal ≤ ε*`, the smooth-domain
RS code admits an `MCALowerWitness` at radius `δ` — i.e. it pins the Grand-MCA threshold from
below, `δ*_C ≥ δ`. So **once the residuals close, the Grand-MCA lower witness at the Johnson
radius `1 − √ρ` follows mechanically.**

The construction routes through the in-tree `MCALowerWitness.ofLe`, feeding it the `ε_mca`
bound from `hab25_mca_johnson_bound` composed with the numeric check. -/

/-- **Hab25 Johnson residuals also make the faithful MCA lattice threshold exist.**

This rounds the certified Johnson radius down to its Hamming lattice point, so downstream code
can move directly from the Hab25 residuals to the faithful lattice threshold without manually
constructing the intermediate `MCALowerWitness`. -/

`johnsonBoundReal` is *definitionally* the value inside `ENNReal.ofReal` of
`MCALowerWitness.ofJohnsonBCHKS25`'s numeric check, so the Hab25 Step-2 residual feeds that
bridge directly. This records the compatibility: the Hab25 skeleton instantiates the very
`MCALowerWitness.ofJohnsonBCHKS25` consumer that the Grand-MCA framework already exposes,
confirming shape-compatibility of the whole pipeline. -/
