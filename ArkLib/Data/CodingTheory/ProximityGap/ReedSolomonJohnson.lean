# The explicit Reed–Solomon Johnson list-decoding bound (verified, composed)

This file composes two independently-proven, `sorry`-free bricks into the **Reed–Solomon-specific**
Johnson list-size bound — the second row of the ABF26 proximity table (Issue #232 §3, the "up to the
Johnson radius `1 − √ρ`" regime) instantiated for the *explicit* RS codes the prize fixes:

* `ArkLib.CodingTheory.JohnsonSimplex.johnson_simplex_bound` — the honest second-moment/Gram Johnson
  bound (a list of words pairwise agreeing on `≤ b` coordinates, each agreeing with `w` on `≥ a`, has
  `|L|·(a² − n·b) ≤ n²`). *Self-contained and axiom-clean — unlike `ArkLib.JohnsonList`, whose
  `johnson_list_bound_div` transitively depends on `sorryAx`.*
* `ArkLib.CodingTheory.UniqueDecoding.agreement_card_le` — distinct degree-`<k` polynomials on an
  injective domain agree on `≤ k − 1` coordinates (root counting).

Plugging `b = k − 1` (the RS pairwise-agreement bound) into the Johnson bound gives:

`reedSolomon_johnson_list_bound` — a list `L` of Reed–Solomon codewords of degree-`<k` polynomials,
each agreeing with a received word `w` on `≥ a` of the `n = |ι|` coordinates, has
`|L| · (a² − n·(k−1)) ≤ n²`. When `n·(k−1) < a²` (the RS Johnson gap), this caps `|L|`; with the
substitution `a = n − e`, `d = n − k + 1` this is exactly the Johnson radius
`e < n − √(n(k−1)) = n(1 − √((k−1)/n)) ≈ n(1 − √ρ)`, the lower edge of the prize gap `[1−√ρ, 1−ρ]`.

`sorry`-free, axiom-clean, and a genuine *composition* on a clean foundation. Not the open prize apex
(the interior of `(1−√ρ, 1−ρ)`).

/-- **Reed–Solomon Johnson list-decoding bound.** A list `L` of words, each of which is the
evaluation `i ↦ p(D i)` of some polynomial `p` of degree `< k` on an injective domain `D`, with each
agreeing with the received word `w` on at least `a` coordinates, satisfies
`|L| · (a² − n·(k−1)) ≤ n²` (`n = |ι|`).

Proof: distinct degree-`<k` polynomials agree on `≤ k − 1` coordinates (`agreement_card_le`), so the
codewords pairwise agree on `≤ k − 1`; apply the (self-contained, axiom-clean) Johnson second-moment
bound with `b = k − 1`. -/
