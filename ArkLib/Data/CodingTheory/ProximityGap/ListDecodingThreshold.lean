# The unique-decoding endpoint of `δ*` (direction A for #232)

`ListSizeMoments.exists_two_of_second_gt_first` gives the *upper* (ambiguity) side of the list
threshold: when the second moment exceeds the first, some received word has `|Λ| ≥ 2`. This file pins
the *lower* (unique) side **exactly** via the triangle inequality:

* `pairBall_eq_zero` — the pair-ball count `N(v,r) = 0` whenever `wt(v) > 2r` (two balls of radius `r`
  centred `wt(v)` apart cannot meet). So in `second_moment_linear = |C|·Σ_{v∈C} N(v,r)`, every nonzero
  codeword beyond weight `2r` contributes nothing.
* `list_le_one_of_min_weight` — if the minimum distance exceeds `2r` (i.e. `r < d/2`), then **every**
  decoding list has size `≤ 1`: unique decoding holds below half the minimum distance.

Together with the ambiguity criterion, this brackets `δ*`: list size is `≤ 1` for `2r < d` and becomes
`≥ 2` once the second moment crosses the first — the unique→list transition sits at half the minimum
distance, recovered here purely from the metric (no FTA/Johnson root bound).

/-- **The pair-ball vanishes beyond weight `2r`.** No vector `g` is within Hamming distance `r` of
both `0` and `v` when `wt(v) > 2r`: by the triangle inequality `wt(v) = d(0,v) ≤ d(0,g) + d(v,g) ≤ 2r`,
a contradiction. Hence `N(v,r) = 0`. -/

/-- **Unique decoding below half the minimum distance.** If every nonzero codeword has weight `> 2r`
(equivalently the minimum distance `d > 2r`, i.e. `r < d/2`), then every decoding list `Λ(C,r,f)` has
size at most `1`. Proof: two distinct codewords `c, c'` within `r` of the same `f` would satisfy
`wt(c-c') = d(c,c') ≤ d(c,f) + d(c',f) ≤ 2r`, contradicting the minimum-weight bound (`c-c'` is a
nonzero codeword by linearity). -/

/-- **Ambiguity appears at half the minimum distance (converse).** If `C` contains `0` and a nonzero
codeword `v` of weight `≤ 2r`, then some received word has a decoding list of size `≥ 2`. The witness
is the explicit metric midpoint `g`: split the support `T` of `v` into `⌊wt/2⌋` coordinates where `g`
agrees with `0` and the rest where `g` agrees with `v`; then `d(0,g) = ⌈wt/2⌉ ≤ r` and
`d(v,g) = ⌊wt/2⌋ ≤ r`, so both `0` and `v` lie in `Λ(C,r,g)`. Together with `list_le_one_of_min_weight`
this pins the unique→list transition **exactly** at radius `⌈d/2⌉`. -/
