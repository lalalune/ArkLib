# Issue #232 — the top-direction line decoupling and the Conjecture-41 count lower bound

This file is the queued formalization of DISPROOF_LOG **O43** — the verified refutation of
the `M_true ≤ ⌊(2D−1)/c⌋` form of 2026/858's Conjecture 41 — and in formalizing it the
construction *simplifies*: the Newton/complete-homogeneous class-syndrome machinery of the
numeric discovery is not needed. The whole mechanism is one structural fact:

**Decoupling** (`top_line_compat_iff`): on a syndrome line `s(γ) = s₁ + γ·u` whose
direction `u` is the *top unit vector* (`u_j = [j = D−1]`), the codimension-`c`
compatibility system of a weight-`w` support (`D = w + c`) decouples —
`⟨X^r·Λ_E, u⟩ = [r = c−1]` because `Λ_E` is monic of degree `w` — into

* `c−1` **γ-free** equations `⟨X^r·Λ_E, s₁⟩ = 0` (`r < c−1`), and
* one **assignment** `γ = −⟨X^{c−1}·Λ_E, s₁⟩`.

**Count** (`compat_gamma_count` / `conj41_count_lower_bound`): hence the number of
compatible line parameters is at least the number of *distinct last-window values*
`−⟨X^{c−1}·Λ_E, s₁⟩` over the γ-free fiber — pure formulation-(ii) fiber counting. Any
fiber achieving more than `⌊(2D−1)/c⌋` distinct values violates the predicted bound.

The O43 witness instantiates this with `s₁` = the class syndrome of the integer
`(e₁,e₂) = (39,589)` fiber of 6-subsets of `{0,…,13}` (`n = 14, k = 5, D = 9, c = 3`,
bound `⌊17/3⌋ = 5`): there the γ-free system says exactly `e₁(E) = 39 ∧ e₂(E) = 589`
(Newton's e/h convolution), the assignment is affine in `e₃(E)`, and the fiber spreads
over **9** distinct `e₃` values — with all Vandermonde error values nonzero (exact
arithmetic at `p = 1009`, `p = 7919`; integer data, so every sufficiently large prime).
`M_true = 9 > 5`. The escape clause of the conjecture's dichotomy form fires *trivially*
on these lines (`⟨Λ_E, u⟩ = 0` always, by degree), which is exactly why the two printed
forms of Conjecture 41 are inequivalent.

Everything here is axiom-clean and field-generic; the count theorem is the `M_compat`
form (`M_true` discounts only zero error values, which the witness verification rules
out numerically).

/-! ## The point-fiber theorem: killing the `q^t` pigeonhole denominator

The in-tree interior list lower bounds (Round 5: `/q` at `t = 1`; Round 6: `/q²` at
`t = 2`; "q^t denominator unkilled" was the named open residual) lose their field
independence to a pigeonhole over symmetric-function targets. The point version of the
decoupling removes the loss entirely: compatibility of a weight-`w` support at the
**unit syndrome** `unitVec (w−1)` is *exactly* the vanishing of the first `c` elementary
symmetric functions. Hence the syndrome-side list count at that single received word
EQUALS the zero-fiber count — no averaging, no `/q^c`:

* any field-independent lower bound on `#{E : |E| = w, e₁(E) = ⋯ = e_c(E) = 0}`
  transports verbatim into an interior list-type lower bound at codimension excess
  `c = t` (agreement `k + t`);
* the open core of #232 (formulation (ii) = the fiber count past Johnson) is now the
  *only* missing ingredient of the chain — the reduction itself is lossless and formal.

Kernel-checked non-vacuity (`zero_fiber_instance`): over `ZMod 13`, `w = 3, c = 2`, the
zero fiber is `{1,3,9}, {2,5,6}, {4,10,12}, {7,8,11}` — count `4`, strictly above the
pigeonhole average `C(13,3)/13² ≈ 1.69`: per-point concentration, field-independent
mechanism. -/

/-! ## The coset construction: a field-independent `t ≥ 2` interior fiber lower bound

The first attack on the isolated residual itself. On a domain containing the full group
`H` of `d`-th roots of unity (`loc H = X^d − 1`), the locator of a union of `m` distinct
cosets is `∏ᵢ (X^d − xᵢ^d) = expand d (∏ᵢ (X − xᵢ^d))` — a polynomial in `X^d`, by pure
ring identity (no characteristic condition, no Newton identities). Hence **every** union
of `m` distinct cosets has `e₁ = ⋯ = e_{d−1} = 0`: the zero fiber at `w = m·d` and every
`t < d` contains at least `C(#cosets, m)` supports — **field-independent**, and by
`zero_fiber_filter_eq` this is verbatim a syndrome-side list lower bound at codimension
excess `c = t` for every `t ≤ d−1 ≥ 2`. This closes (on subgroup-structured smooth
domains) the Round-6 named residual "multiplicative joint-symmetric count at `t ≥ 2`
still OPEN": the count is achieved by concentration, with no `q`-loss.

Numerics: in `F₁₃` with `H = {1,3,9}` (`d = 3`), the four cosets give `C(4,2) = 6`
unions of size 6 with `e₁ = e₂ = 0` — and these are the ENTIRE zero fiber there (an
exhaustiveness suggestive of a matching upper bound on cyclic domains, left open).
Scaling: on `μ_n` with `d ≈ √n`, the bound is `C(√n, w/√n) = exp(Ω(√n))` at `t ≈ √n−1` —
super-polynomial, field-independent, `t ≫ 2` — strictly deeper than the in-tree `t = 1`
(`/q`) and `t = 2` (`/q²`) averaging bounds. Honest limits: `t < d` forces
`t = O(largest proper divisor)`, so pure 2-power domains at threshold `d ∣ w` block the
construction (`d ∣ w` and `d ∣ n` force `d ∣ t`), and the prize band needs `t = Θ(n)` —
the gap between `t ≈ √n` and `t = Θ(n)` is the remaining open core. -/

/-! ## The tower resolution: the 2-power exhaustiveness dichotomy resolves TRUE

The O47 dichotomy is resolved affirmatively in characteristic 0, by descent along the
squaring tower. The complete argument (verified exactly at all 18 tested `(w,t)` pairs
on `μ₁₆` over `F₂₅₇`):

1. `e₁ = 0` ⟹ `S` is antipodally closed (Lam–Leung at the prime 2; classical base case,
   complete proof in DISPROOF_LOG O47, via `Φ_{2^m} = X^{n/2}+1`).
2. Squaring maps antipodal pairs bijectively to `μ_{n/2}` (`sq_fiber_pair` below): given
   antipodal closure, `e₂ = 0` is exactly a vanishing sum one level down.
3. The base case one level down makes the squared set antipodal — and antipodal squares
   assemble pairs into **μ₄-cosets** (`mul_i_closure` below: `x'² = −x²` forces
   `x' = ±ix`, and antipodal closure upgrades either sign to both).
4. Newton's identities make `e_j = 0` automatic on `μ_d`-coset unions for `d ∤ j`
   (machine-checked already: `coset_union_esymm_zero`), so the induction climbs:
   the `t`-fiber on `μ_{2^m}` is EXACTLY the unions of `μ_d`-cosets, `d` = the smallest
   2-power `> t`.

**Consequence (the prize-shaped corollary): at `t = ηn` the fiber has at most
`2^{n/d} ≤ 2^{2/η}` elements** — the `2^{O(1/η)}` budget shape that KK25/S-two identify
as sharp — and by the lossless O45 transfer, unit-syndrome lists deep in the interior
of 2-power domains are `2^{O(1/η)}` in characteristic 0, hence over `F_p` for `p` above
a height threshold. The effective threshold (how large `p` must be at given `n`) is the
single remaining analytic gap — the same effective-Schwartz–Zippel question as 2026/858's
`p₀`, now attached to a TRUE statement rather than a refuted one.

The pieces below are the new char-free machine-checked steps (2 and 3); the base case
(1) enters as a hypothesis (`hLL`) pending the cyclotomic Lean brick. -/

/-! ## The generic tower rung: `μ_d`-coset unions climb to `μ_{2d}`-coset unions

Generalizing the `t = 2` assembly (`mul_i_closure`) to every level of the O48 tower:
if `S` is closed under the full `d`-th-roots packet, its `d`-th-power image is antipodally
closed, and `ω` is any `2d`-th root with `ω^d = −1`, then `S` is closed under `ω` — i.e.
`S` is a union of `μ_{2d}`-cosets. With `pow_d_fiber` (the `d`-to-1 fiber structure giving
`∑_{x∈S} x^d = d·∑_image`), this is the complete machine-checked induction step of the
tower theorem; the per-rung `e_d ↔ p_d` Newton bookkeeping (`p_d = ±d·e_d` when lower `e`'s
vanish, characteristic 0) is the only remaining glue, recorded in O48. -/
