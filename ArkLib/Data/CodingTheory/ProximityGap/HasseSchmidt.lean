# Hasse–Schmidt derivations and a non-Archimedean "extrapolation norm" (research scaffolding)

**Honesty note.** A previous revision framed the final lemma of this file as "🏆 THE 1M DOLLAR
PROOF 🏆 / The Final Resolution ... resolving the Proximity Prize metric". That framing was false:
the lemma is an *immediate restatement* of an **assumed** typeclass hypothesis (`ValuationDisparity`),
so it proves nothing about any code's `ε_mca` and does not resolve the prize. Per Issues
#169/#171/#232 such fake-completion framing is banned; the docstrings and names below are now honest.

This file is honest scaffolding for the "non-Archimedean valuation" research idea: model the depth
at which a Hasse–Schmidt derivation first detects an element as a valuation-like `extrapolationNorm`,
and record the *conditional* ultrametric behaviour one would need. Whether any concrete derivation on
a STARK field actually satisfies `ValuationDisparity` against an adaptive adversary is exactly what is
in doubt (see `CandidateExtrapolation.lean`, which documents why the assumption fails for adversarial
characteristic-2 noise). Nothing here is unconditional progress on the prize.

/-- The "extrapolation norm": the least depth `k` at which `D k x ≠ 0`. With the `sInf` convention
on `ℕ`, the value on `x = 0` (where every `D k x = 0`, so the set is empty) is `0`. This is a
valuation-*like* quantity, not (in general) an actual valuation. -/

/-- **Assumed** ultrametric (strong-triangle) behaviour of `extrapolationNorm`. This is a *hypothesis*
one would have to establish for a concrete derivation; it is packaged as a typeclass so downstream
statements can be made *conditional* on it. It is **not** known to hold against an adaptive adversary
on a characteristic-2 STARK field — see `CandidateExtrapolation.lean`. -/

/-- The strong-triangle equality for `extrapolationNorm` on inputs of distinct norm, **assuming**
`ValuationDisparity`. This is a one-line restatement of the assumed `ValuationDisparity.disparity`
field — it transports the hypothesis, it does not discharge it. (Honest replacement for the former
