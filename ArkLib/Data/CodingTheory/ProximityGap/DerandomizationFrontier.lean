Round 14, Angle E — the DERANDOMIZATION frontier of the proximity-prize list-size problem
(ABF26 / ArkLib #232), formalized HONESTLY over a general finite alphabet.

Context. The known capacity results for Reed–Solomon list decoding (GZ23: randomly punctured
RS codes achieve list-decoding capacity; GG25: random RS codes have mutual correlated
agreement up to capacity) hold for RANDOM evaluation sets.  The prize statement fixes an
EXPLICIT smooth multiplicative-subgroup evaluation domain.  The gap between
"some evaluation set of size n works" and "the explicit subgroup domain works" is the
derandomization core.  This file:

(a) defines `ListDecodableTo` (relative-radius list decodability) and its absolute-agreement
    form `ListDecodableAbs`, with a PROVED exact bridge (`listDecodableTo_iff_abs`);
(b) states the derandomization question as named Props (`ExistsGoodDomain`,
    `AllSubgroupDomainsGood`, `DerandomizationCore`) — the core is stated and deliberately
    NOT asserted anywhere;
(c) PROVES the genuinely-true structural fragments about puncturing one evaluation point:
    (i)   `listDecodableAbs_punctureCode` — at the SAME absolute agreement threshold t,
          list decodability survives puncturing (relative to the smaller domain this is a
          margin gain, which is exactly why it is true);
    (ii)  `naive_margin_fails_concrete` — the naive guess
          "absolute threshold t implies threshold t-1 on the punctured domain with the same
          list size" is REFUTED by an explicit counterexample (so the q-factor below is
          genuinely needed);
    (iii) `listDecodableAbs_punctureCode_pigeonhole` — the CORRECT margin version: threshold
          t+1 with list L implies threshold t on the punctured domain with list |F|·L
          (pigeonhole over the deleted coordinate), and `pigeonhole_tight_concrete` shows
          the factor |F| is tight on the same counterexample;
    (iv)  `listDecodableAbs_of_punctureCode` — the transfer direction used in
          derandomization: a good punctured (smaller, possibly explicit) domain pulls back
          to the original domain with threshold t+1, given injectivity of puncturing;
    (v)   trivial endpoint facts and concrete non-degenerate instances for everything.

What is NOT proven here: `DerandomizationCore` itself (whether existence of a good size-n
evaluation set implies the smooth subgroup domains are good).  That is the open research
content; it is stated as a `def ... : Prop` only and never claimed.

/-! ## Part 2: the naive guess is FALSE — explicit counterexample, and tightness of the
pigeonhole factor.

Code `C₀ = {000, 111} ⊆ Bool^3`.  It is list decodable at absolute threshold 2 with list
size 1 (the two codewords are at distance 3, and any word agrees with both on a total of
exactly 3 coordinates, so never twice with each).  Puncture the last coordinate: the word
`01` agrees on exactly 1 coordinate with BOTH punctured codewords `00` and `11`, so at
threshold `2 - 1 = 1` the punctured list has size 2.  Hence
"`ListDecodableAbs C t L` implies `ListDecodableAbs (puncture C) (t-1) L`" is FALSE,

/-- THE OPEN DERANDOMIZATION CORE — stated only, deliberately NOT asserted or proved
anywhere in this file.  The random-puncturing capacity results (GZ23, GG25) certify
`ExistsGoodDomain` in the capacity regime (`t` slightly above `k`, `L` constant); the
proximity prize needs `AllSubgroupDomainsGood` for explicit smooth domains.  Whether the
implication holds — i.e. whether the existential certificate can be derandomized to the
explicit subgroup domain — is the open research content beyond the Johnson radius. -/
