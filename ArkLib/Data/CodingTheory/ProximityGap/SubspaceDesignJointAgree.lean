# Joint agreement against a subspace design is small (B2 list-decoding ingredient) (#389, #334)

The open producer step (proving the explicit code is curve-decodable) is bounding the list of
codeword-curves via the subspace-design property the fleet proved for folded RS.  This file supplies
the core list-decoding ingredient: `subspaceDesign_jointAgree_card_le` — if `r+1` codewords with
linearly independent differences all agree with a word `y` on a set `S`, then `|S| ≤ τ(r)·n`.

On `S` every difference vanishes, so the dimension-`r` span of the differences fully vanishes on
`S`, and `subspaceDesign_fullVanish_card_le` caps such coordinates at `τ(r)·n`.  This is exactly the
mechanism that prevents many codeword-curves from sharing a large agreement region: a fresh codeword
extends a joint agreement on at most a `τ(r)`-fraction of coordinates, which is what forces the
close-set list onto few curves in the GG25 / Guruswami–Xing argument.  Axiom-clean.

/-- **Joint agreement against a subspace design is small.**  If `r+1` codewords of a
`τ`-subspace-design `C` have linearly independent differences `c_{j+1} − c₀` (so they span a
dimension-`r` subspace of `C`) and they *all* agree with a word `y` on a set `S`, then
`|S| ≤ τ(r)·n`.  On `S` every difference vanishes, so the dimension-`r` span fully vanishes on `S`,
and the subspace-design bound `subspaceDesign_fullVanish_card_le` caps such coordinates at `τ(r)·n`.
This is the list-decoding ingredient: a fresh codeword can extend a joint agreement only on a
`τ(r)`-fraction of coordinates, which is what forces the list onto few curves. -/
