# Averaging crossover as an explicit `delta*` UPPER bound for a parameterized RS-like family

Ethereum Proximity Prize attack (ABF26 / ArkLib #232), ANGLE 3.

This file turns the *averaging list LOWER bound*

  `maxList(1 - (k+t)/n)  >=  C(n, k+t) / q^t`

into an explicit `delta*` UPPER bound for a Reed--Solomon-style family parameterized in `n`
(not a single numeral): if the family parameters satisfy `C(n,k+t) > E * q^(t+1)`, where `E`
models the soundness budget `eps* = E / q` (so the absolute list budget at field size `|F| = q`
is `eps* * |F| = E * q`), then the actual RS list at radius `delta = 1 - (k+t)/n` strictly
EXCEEDS `E * q = eps* * |F|`. Hence the proximity threshold satisfies `delta* < 1 - (k+t)/n`.

## What is genuinely proved (no axioms beyond `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`)

* `tupleToPoly` and its lemmas: every coefficient tuple `c : Fin k -> F` is a *genuine*
  degree-`< k` polynomial `sum_j c_j X^j`, the map is INJECTIVE, and we identify its
  coefficients and evaluation. So the coefficient-tuple list and the honest
  `Finset (Polynomial F)` list have the SAME cardinality (`rsListPoly_card_eq`).

* `averaging_pigeonhole`: the re-proved, self-contained pigeonhole. From an INJECTION
  `phi : S -> list x E` whose first component lands in `list`, with `E` a Fintype, one gets
  `|S| <= |list| * |E|`. Instantiated with `|S| = C(n,k+t)` and `|E| = q^t` this is exactly the
  averaging list lower bound `|list| >= C(n,k+t)/q^t` (`rsList_card_ge_of_injection`).

* `deltaStar_upper_bound_general`: the headline theorem, parameterized in `(n,k,t,q,E)`
  as a FAMILY. Given the averaging lower bound `C(n,k+t) <= |list| * q^t` and the family
  crossover `C(n,k+t) > E * q^(t+1)`, it concludes `|list| > E * q`. The hypothesis
  `C(n,k+t) <= |list| * q^t` is precisely what `rsList_card_ge_of_injection` supplies from an
  injection, so this closes the gap between the bracket arithmetic and the real RS list.

* A CONCRETE non-vacuous instance over the real field `ZMod 17`, `n = 8`, `k = 2`, `t = 1`,
  with an injective evaluation map `D : Fin 8 -> ZMod 17` and an explicit received word. We
  compute the genuine RS list (degree-`< 2` polynomials agreeing with the word on `>= k+t = 3`
  points) and prove by `decide` that it has exactly `5` elements, that this is a POSITIVE list,
  and that it STRICTLY EXCEEDS the averaging crossover value `C(8,3) / 17^1 = 3`. We also
  exhibit a positive budget parameter `E` for which `|list| > E * q` holds, confirming the
  threshold is actually exceeded (the inequality is strict and the witnesses are concrete).

## What is NOT proved here (honest scope)

We do not synthesize the injection `S -> list x E` from RS geometry in general; the general
lower bound is stated *conditioned on* such an injection (or equivalently on the inequality
`C(n,k+t) <= |list| * q^t`), which is exactly the averaging content established in prior rounds.
The CONCRETE instance discharges the lower bound directly by exhaustive computation, so it is
unconditional and non-vacuous. We do not connect `delta*` to a protocol soundness definition;
"`delta* < 1 - (k+t)/n`" is the informal reading of "list exceeds the budget at that radius".

/-! ## The headline `delta*` UPPER bound (parameterized FAMILY in `n`)

The soundness budget: `eps* = E / q`, so the absolute list budget at field size `q = |F|` is
`eps* * |F| = E * q`. If the averaging lower bound `C(n,k+t) <= |list| * q^t` holds and the
family parameters cross the threshold `C(n,k+t) > E * q^(t+1)`, then the RS list at radius
`delta = 1 - (k+t)/n` strictly exceeds the budget `E * q`. Soundness at that radius is therefore
violated, so the proximity threshold obeys `delta* < 1 - (k+t)/n`. -/

/-- **`delta*` upper bound, general parameterized family.**
Hypotheses (all in `ℕ`, with `q >= 1`):
* `hlb : Nat.choose n (k+t) ≤ list.card * q^t` — the averaging list lower bound
  (supplied by `averaging_list_lower_bound` from an injection `S -> list x E`, `|E| = q^t`);
* `hcross : E * q^(t+1) < Nat.choose n (k+t)` — the family crossover
  `C(n,k+t) > E * q^(t+1)`, i.e. `eps* * q^(t+1) < C(n,k+t)`.

Conclusion: `E * q < list.card`, i.e. the RS list at radius `delta = 1 - (k+t)/n` strictly
EXCEEDS the soundness budget `E * q = eps* * |F|`. Equivalently `delta* < 1 - (k+t)/n`. -/

The first instance is honest but, for those tiny parameters, only the trivial budget `E = 0`
satisfies the crossover. To show the `delta*` upper bound bites with a genuinely positive
budget, we give a second instance over `ZMod 11`, `n = 11`, `k = 2`, `t = 1`, `q = 11`, with the
word `w i = (D i)^3` (a degree-`3` word). The genuine RS list (degree-`< 2` polynomials agreeing
on `>= 3` points) has exactly `15` elements. With `E = 1` (so `eps* = 1/q`, an honest positive
budget) the crossover `C(11,3) = 165 > 121 = 1 * 11^2` holds, and the list `15 > 11 = E * q`
strictly exceeds the budget. (Note `C(11,3)/q^t = 165/11 = 15`, so the averaging bound is met
