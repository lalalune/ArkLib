/-- **The root-order / factor step (Sudan, multiplicity 1).**  Let `Q : (F[X])[Y]` satisfy the
`(1, k−1)`-weighted degree bound `< D`, and let `f` be a polynomial of degree `≤ k−1` such that
`Q(α, f(α)) = 0` for all `α` in a set `A` of at least `D` points (the **agreement points**: at each
the received word equals `f`, and `Q` vanishes there).  Then the univariate `Q(X, f(X))` has `≥ D`
roots but degree `< D`, hence is zero — so **`(Y − f) ∣ Q`** in `(F[X])[Y]`.

This is the middle step of the Guruswami–Sudan pipeline, in general form: it converts an agreement
count into a polynomial factor, feeding the `Y`-degree list cap. -/

/-! ## Non-vacuity: a concrete instance where the factor step fires. -/

/-- **Non-vacuity.**  Over `F = ℚ`, take `Q = Y` (the outer variable, a genuine nonzero bivariate),
`f = 0` (degree `0 ≤ k−1 = 1`), `D = 2`, and `A = {0, 1}` (two agreement points).  The weighted-degree
hypothesis holds (`Q`'s only nonzero coefficient is at `j = 1`, with `deg 1 + 1·1 = 1 < 2`); the
agreement hypothesis holds (`Q(X, 0) = 0` vanishes everywhere).  `factor_of_agreement` fires and
concludes `(Y − C 0) ∣ Y` — exercising every hypothesis concretely. -/
