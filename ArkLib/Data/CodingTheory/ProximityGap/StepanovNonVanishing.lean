# Issue #232 — the Stepanov non-vanishing, PROVEN (squarefree / integrally-closed argument).

`StepanovWeilSubstrate.lean` reduced the #232 Weil bound to the Stepanov auxiliary's
**non-vanishing**: that the constructed `R(X) = A₀(X, X^q) + g(X)^((q−1)/2)·A₁(X, X^q)` is not the
zero polynomial. This file pins that down completely:

## The algebraic chain `squarefree ⟹ Y²−g irreducible` (proven)

* `squarefree_not_isSquare` / `squarefree_not_isSquare_ratFunc` — a squarefree `g` of positive degree
  is not a square in `F[X]`, nor in the rational function field `RatFunc F` (integrally-closed route).
* `X_sq_sub_C_irreducible_iff_not_isSquare` — over any field, `X²−C c` is irreducible iff `c` is not a
  square (Kummer `p = 2`).
* `squarefree_quadratic_irreducible_ratFunc` (the chain) — for `g` squarefree of positive degree,
  `Y²−g` is **irreducible** over `RatFunc F` (i.e. the hyperelliptic curve `Y²=g(X)` is geometrically
  the right object). This discharges the *irreducibility precondition* of the genus argument.

## The base-`q` substitution machinery and faithfulness (proven)

* `subq q A := A(X, X^q)` for `A ∈ F[X][Y]`, with `subq_eq_sum`, `subq_add`, `subq_C_mul`,
  `coeff_subq_digit`, and the keystone `subq_eq_zero_iff` — **`Y↦X^q` is injective on
  `deg_X < q` two-variable polynomials** (base-`q` blocks do not overlap).
* `aux_collapses_to_relation` — `R = 0` collapses to the algebraic relation `A₀ + C(g^((q−1)/2))·A₁ = 0`
  **iff** the *combined* X-blocks all have degree `< q`.

## The precise obstruction, and the wall as one named hypothesis (honest)

* `obstruction_combined_digit_fails` — the combined-digit hypothesis **provably fails** in the
  relevant regime (`deg g·(q−1)/2 ≥ q`): the second term's block overflows the digit, so the two
  terms cancel *across* base-`q` blocks. The elementary base-`q` route therefore **cannot** close the
  non-vanishing — this is machine-checked, not asserted.
* `aux_key_claim_under_irreducibility` — the non-vanishing conclusion `A₀ = A₁ = 0`, carried under the
  single **named hypothesis** `hIrred` (the absolute-irreducibility / genus / Riemann–Roch consequence
  that the relation `A₀ = −g^((q−1)/2)·A₁` has only the trivial solution). SUPERSEDED by `obstruction_forces_trivial` (§5), which proves the non-vanishing outright; the
  earlier reading was that ruling out the cross-block cancellation requires counting `F`-points on
  `Y²=g(X)` (Hasse–Weil), which recovers **only the Johnson radius `√ρ`**, never the past-Johnson `δ*`
  prize #232 actually asks for.

Net: the entire Stepanov non-vanishing is now machine-checked (`obstruction_forces_trivial`, §5),
axiom-clean, with NO named genus hypothesis. Honest: even the full Weil bound recovers Johnson,
not the past-Johnson prize. `#232`/`#389` stay the open tracker for the deep-band supply wall.

All results are `sorry`-free and axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).

/-! ## 5. The genuine non-vanishing, PROVEN: the squarefree / integrally-closed argument.

The `aux_collapses_to_relation` route above is a dead end (`obstruction_combined_digit_fails`:
its combined-digit hypothesis is *false* in the relevant regime). But the non-vanishing does
**not** need that collapse, and it is **not** "genus content Mathlib lacks". The correct argument
(Kopparty, *The Weil bounds*, Lemma 3 = Hanson, *Stepanov's Method for Hyperelliptic Curves*,
Lemma 5) **squares first**: from `R = subq A₀ + g^((q−1)/2)·subq A₁ = 0` one gets
`(subq A₀)² = g^(q−1)·(subq A₁)²`, then multiplies by `g` and uses `g^q = g(X^q) = subq ĝ`
(`pow_card_eq_subq_map_C`) to fold *both* sides through `subq` — now with `X`-blocks of degree
`< q`, so faithfulness (`subq_eq_zero_iff`) applies and yields the genuine `F[X][Y]` identity
`C g · A₀² = ĝ · A₁²` (i.e. `g(X)·A₀² = g(Y)·A₁²`). Squarefree `g` of positive degree then forces
`A₀ = A₁ = 0` by the integrally-closed argument (`genus_squarefree_forces_trivial`), which is the
**same** `IsIntegrallyClosed` route already used here for the one-variable
`squarefree_not_isSquare_ratFunc`. This closes the Stepanov non-vanishing wall outright,
axiom-clean — superseding the named hypothesis `hIrred` of `aux_key_claim_under_irreducibility`.

Honest scope unchanged: the Weil bound recovers the **Johnson** radius `√ρ`, never the
past-Johnson `δ*` prize (#389/#232 stay the open tracker for the deep-band supply wall). -/

/-- **THE GENUS STATEMENT, PROVEN.** Over a finite field `F`, `C g · A₀² = ĝ · A₁²`
(`g(X)·A₀² = g(Y)·A₁²`) with `g` squarefree of positive degree forces `A₀ = A₁ = 0`. This is
exactly the consequence `hIrred` named as "Mathlib-lacking genus content"; it is the
integrally-closed argument, here discharged. -/

/-- **THE STEPANOV NON-VANISHING, PROVEN (no `hIrred`).** Over a finite field `F` with `q = |F|`
odd, for `g` squarefree of positive degree: if the combined square-blocks `C g·A₀² − ĝ·A₁²` have
`X`-degree `< q` and the auxiliary `R = subq A₀ + g^((q−1)/2)·subq A₁` vanishes, then `A₀ = A₁ = 0`.
Squares first (so faithfulness applies), then closes by `genus_squarefree_forces_trivial`. -/
