# The monomial word has unconditionally polynomial supply (#389)

The whole #389 supply wall is about the worst-case ARBITRARY word.  This file proves the
**monomial** word `x ↦ (dom x)^{k+m+1}` is NOT part of the wall: its explainable-core count
is unconditionally polynomial in `n`, on **any** domain, with no Garcia–Voloch/Stepanov
input.

Mechanism (polynomial division).  A `(k+m+1)`-subset `T` is explainable for the monomial
word iff its vanishing polynomial `V_T = ∏_{i∈T}(X − dom i)` satisfies `(V_T − X^{k+m+1})`
has degree `< k` (the first `m+1` elementary symmetric functions vanish).  Then for **any**
`k`-subset `S ⊆ T`, writing `V_S = ∏_{i∈S}(X − dom i)` (monic, degree `k`):
`V_S ∣ V_T`, so `V_T = V_S · (V_T /ₘ V_S)`, and the quotient is forced — if `T, T'` are both
explainable and share `S`, then `V_S·(Q − Q') = V_T − V_{T'}` has degree `< k = deg V_S`,
hence `Q = Q'` and `V_T = V_{T'}`, so `T = T'` (the roots, hence `dom(T)`, coincide).

So each `k`-subset is contained in **at most one** explainable core, and double-counting the
incidences `(T, S)` gives:

* `monomial_supply_choose_le` — **`#cores · C(k+m+1, k) ≤ C(n, k)`**, i.e.
  `#cores ≤ C(n,k)/C(k+m+1,k)`, unconditional, any domain, every band.

This generalizes `CubicSupplyExact`/`QuarticPowerSumFiber` to all bands and removes the
GV-conditionality for the monomial family — sharply isolating the supply wall to genuinely
NON-monomial (arbitrary `u₀`) words.
