# Field-dependence of the Garcia–Voloch excess: `μ_10 ⊆ F_101` (#389)

A companion to `ConcreteWeilInstanceMu10` (`μ_10 ⊆ F_31`, excess `120`, `C = 2`) at the **same
order** but a different field, exhibiting that the Garcia–Voloch energy excess is genuinely
*field-dependent*: `μ_10 ⊆ F_101` (the 10th roots of unity, with `6` a primitive 10th root) is
**exactly Sidon-modulo-negation** — additive energy `E = 270 = 3·10² − 3·10`, so `energyExcess = 0`
and the `C = 0` branch fires with no residual:

> **`mu10_F101_gvRepBound`** — `GVRepBound (μ_10 ⊆ F_101) 6`: every nonzero `t` has at most `6`
> additive representations (`(3+0)·10 = 30 ≤ 6² = 36`, `6³ = 216 ≤ 64·10² = 6400`).

So at order 10 the excess drops from `120` (over `F_31`) to `0` (over `F_101`): the larger field is
"more generic", matching the `n²/p → 0` Sidon-modulo-negation prediction (`100/101 ≈ 1` vs `100/31`).
Every hypothesis (including the energy `E = 270`) is discharged by `decide`; axiom-clean.
