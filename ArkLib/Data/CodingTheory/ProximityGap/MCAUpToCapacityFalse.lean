# The up-to-capacity MCA bound is FALSE near capacity (#232, MCA negative side)

The mutual correlated agreement error `ε_mca` is what WHIR/STARK soundness actually needs. Here we
give a **gap-free** counterexample to the up-to-capacity MCA bound, driven by the sunflower
lower bound `ProximityGap.MCANearCapacityGK.epsMCA_ge_of_prefix_sunflower`
(`ε_mca(RS[α,k], 1−(k+1)/n) ≥ (n−k)/|F|`):

> For a Reed–Solomon code `RS[F, α, k]` with `1 ≤ k ≤ n` over a field with
> `|F| < (n−k)·2^128`, at the near-capacity radius `δ = 1 − (k+1)/n`:
>
>   `ε* < ε_mca(RS, δ)`,    `ε* = 2^{-128}`     (`rs_mca_uptoCapacity_false_of_smallField`).

So no resolution can place the MCA threshold `δ*` at or above `1 − (k+1)/n` in this
field regime — the up-to-capacity MCA conjecture fails. Unlike `MCAConjectureRefutation`
(which routes through the external `rs_epsCA_breakdown_cs25` placeholder), this is fully
self-contained and axiom-clean.

The field bound `|F| < (n−k)·2^128` covers, at rate `1/2` with `n ≤ 2^40`, fields up to
`≈ 2^{167}`. The full prize range up to `2^256` requires `n^{Ω(1)}` bad scalars with a larger
exponent (the CS25 list-explosion spread), which is the genuinely open construction.

All results are hole-free and axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).

/-- **The up-to-capacity MCA bound fails near capacity (small-field regime).** For an RS code
with `1 ≤ k ≤ n` over a field with `|F| < (n−k)·2^128`, the MCA error at the
near-capacity radius `δ = 1 − (k+1)/n` exceeds the prize threshold `ε* = 2^{-128}`.
Hence the MCA threshold `δ*` cannot reach `1 − (k+1)/n`. -/
