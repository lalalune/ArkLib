# Round 12 (Issue #232, ABF26) — the PRIZE-REGIME additive energy: F₂₅₇ (Fermat smooth field) and
# the located char-0 crossover.

The `SubgroupAdditiveEnergyF17`/`…TowerF17` data lived in the `|G| ~ q` regime (`q = 17`). This file
moves into the **prize regime `|G| ≪ q`** on a genuinely prize-faithful smooth field: `F₂₅₇`, whose
multiplicative group has order `256 = 2⁸` (fully 2-power smooth — `257 = 2^{2^3}+1` is a Fermat
prime). All energies by `decide`, `sorry`-free, axiom-clean.

## The key finding: char-0 anti-concentration PERSISTS into the prize regime, with a located crossover

Exact additive energies of the `F₂₅₇^×` 2-power-subgroup tower:

| order `|G|` | `E(G)` | `3|G|²` (char-0 min) | `E/|G|²` | char-0 bound `E ≤ 3|G|²`? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2  | 6   | 12  | 1.50  | ✓ |
| 4  | 36  | 48  | 2.25  | ✓ |
| 8  | 168 | 192 | 2.625 | ✓ (**below** the char-0 minimum — minimal energy / anti-concentration) |
| 16 | 912 | 768 | 3.562 | ✗ (crossover) |

So on the prize-faithful smooth field the char-0 bound `E ≤ 3|G|²` **holds through order 8 and first
fails at order 16** — the anti-concentration/concentration crossover is *located* at `|G|` between
`8` and `16` for `q = 257`.

## The `|G|`-vs-`q` dependence, made concrete

The **same** order-8 subgroup has additive energy `264` over `F₁₇` (`SubgroupAdditiveEnergyF17`,
`|G| ~ q`) but `168` over `F₂₅₇` (`|G| ≪ q`): as `q` grows into the prize regime the energy **drops
to the char-0 value `168`** (the additive energy of the complex 8-th roots of unity). The `repCount`
counterexample `repCount = 3 > 2` (`SubgroupRepCountFiniteFieldCounterexample`, over the small field
`F₁₇`) is thus a **small-`q` artifact**: in the deployed regime `|G| ≪ q` the small smooth subgroups
are minimally anti-concentrated, exactly as in characteristic 0. The open prize quantity is precisely
*where the crossover sits* as `|G|, q → ∞` — here pinned, for `q = 257`, between orders 8 and 16.
