# Frobenius reduction and the Stepanov non-vanishing wall (Issue #232, Stepanov route)

The Stepanov method bounds `#V` (the `𝔽_q`-rational points) by an auxiliary `Ψ` with
`#V · M ≤ deg Ψ`. The `√q` saving appears only when `deg Ψ` is taken as the degree of `Ψ`
**reduced modulo the Frobenius relation** `x^q = x` (so the effective degree is `< q`, not the
naive monomial degree). The genuine wall — identified by the architecture recon — is then:

> the reduced auxiliary must be **nonzero as a function on `𝔽_q`**; a nonzero *polynomial* can
> become the zero *function* after `x^q ≡ x` reduction.

This file makes that wall **concrete and checkable**: it introduces the reduction
`reduceFrob Ψ := Ψ %ₘ (X^q − X)` and proves

* `eval_reduceFrob` — `reduceFrob Ψ` agrees with `Ψ` at every point of `𝔽_q`
  (because `X^q − X` vanishes on `𝔽_q`, `FiniteField.pow_card`);
* `natDegree_reduceFrob_lt` — `reduceFrob Ψ` has degree `< q` (it is a remainder mod a degree-`q`
  monic), so it lies in the regime where "few roots ⟹ zero" applies;
* `vanishesOn_iff_reduceFrob_eq_zero` — **the wall, reformulated**: `Ψ` vanishes on *all* of `𝔽_q`
  iff `reduceFrob Ψ = 0`. Hence `Ψ` is a *nonzero function on `𝔽_q`* iff `reduceFrob Ψ ≠ 0` — a
  decidable polynomial condition replacing the analytic non-vanishing statement;
* `exists_eval_ne_zero_of_reduceFrob_ne_zero` — the usable contrapositive.

The genuinely-provable half (a nonzero polynomial of degree `< q` cannot vanish on all `q` points,
`Polynomial.eq_zero_of_natDegree_lt_card_of_eval_eq_zero`) is discharged here. What remains open is
purely the **construction-side residual**: proving that the *specific* Stepanov auxiliary's reduction
is nonzero (the "leading-term survives the `x^q`-reduction" argument) and that its multiplicity at
the rational points is preserved under reduction. Those depend on the (unbuilt) special-form
construction and are exactly the open core; this file does not claim them.

## Honest scope
Infrastructure + cartography for the Stepanov route to the Weil bound (`advancesOpenCore = false`).
No `√q`-strength bound is proven; #232 stays an open tracker. All `sorry`-free, axiom-clean.
