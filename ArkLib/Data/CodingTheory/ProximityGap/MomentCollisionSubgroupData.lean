# Issue #232 (ABF26) — a machine-checked M2 value for a real smooth domain.

The prize-deciding scalar is `M2 = collisionCount G a` (the second moment of the `(∑x, ∑x²)` count;
`SubsetSumSecondMomentCollision.lean`), sandwiched in `[C(n,a), C(n,a)²]`. `MomentCollisionRigidity.lean`
shows it sits at its floor `C(n,a)` for all `a ≤ 2` (any field), but says nothing for `a ≥ 3`. This
file pins the **actual value at `a = 3`** for an explicit prize-faithful evaluation domain, by a light
`decide` (over the statistic *image*, not the `C(8,3)²` collision product).

## Contents

* `collisionCount_eq_of_injOn`, `collisionCount_eq_of_image_card_eq` — the reusable structural converse
  of the concentration handle: if the `(∑x, ∑x²)` statistic is injective on the `a`-subsets (equiv. its
  image has `C(|G|,a)` distinct values), then `collisionCount G a = C(|G|, a)` — `M2` at its floor.
* `G17` — the order-`8` multiplicative subgroup `⟨2⟩ = {x : x⁸ = 1}` of `F₁₇`, a genuine smooth
  (power-of-two) FRI/STARK evaluation domain.
* `G17_image_card` — `decide`: the `(∑x, ∑x²)` image of the `3`-subsets of `G17` has `56 = C(8,3)`
  distinct values.
* `G17_collisionCount_at_floor` — **the data point:** `collisionCount G17 3 = 56`. The `(∑x, ∑x²)`
  statistic is **injective on `3`-subsets** of this real subgroup — `M2` is maximally anti-concentrated
  (the prize-favourable regime) even at `a = 3`, *beyond* the rigidity guarantee. Equivalently, this
  subgroup contains no Prouhet–Tarry–Escott multigrade of size `3` (no two disjoint `3`-subsets with
  equal `∑x` and equal `∑x²`). A first machine-checked M2 value for an explicit smooth domain.

## Honest scope

`sorry`-free, axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; plain `decide`, no
`native_decide`). This is a single small instance (`a = 3`, `|G| = 8`), data informing the open
magnitude — not a general bound on `M2`, which remains the open Weil-on-curves content.
