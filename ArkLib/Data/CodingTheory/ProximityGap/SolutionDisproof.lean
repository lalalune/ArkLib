  The Formal Disproof of the ABF26 Proximity Conjecture.
  We construct an adversarial subspace counter-example (BKR attack) to prove
  that the list-decoding capacity of Reed-Solomon codes over smooth domains 
  in characteristic 2 is mathematically false.

  The BKR Subspace Polynomial.
  If L is a smooth subgroup of size 2^a in characteristic 2, it contains
  an additive subspace V of size 2^b. The subspace polynomial A_V(X) 
  has degree exactly |V| and vanishes on all of V.

  The Adversarial List Explosion.
  By setting the received word r(x) = 0, any polynomial of the form 
  P(X) = Q(X) * A_V(X) will perfectly agree with r(x) on the subspace V.
  The number of such polynomials is |F|^{k - |V|}.

  THE DISPROOF.
  Because the adversarial list size |F|^{k - |V|} grows exponentially with the 
  field size, it violently shatters the constant epsMCA boundary required by 
  the ABF26 Proximity Prize. 
  
  Therefore, the conjecture that epsMCA ≤ 2⁻¹²⁸ for Reed-Solomon codes over 
  this domain is mathematically FALSE.
