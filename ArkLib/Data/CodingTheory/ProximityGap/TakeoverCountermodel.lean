# The take-over countermodel: `CensusUpperExtremalFloor` is FALSE at the death radius

Second red-team kill in the census-conditional pin chain (#357). The floor repair
(`CensusExtremalFloor.lean`) asserted that at the adjacent family's death radii nothing
takes over beyond the universal `1/|F|` floor. The registered falsifier — the
higher-monomial scan at the death rung — found a take-over
(`probe_takeover_death_radius.py`, certificates re-verified by an independent fitter):

**At `(n,k) = (16,4)` over `F₉₇`, at the death rung `a = 7` (where the adjacent census is
empty), the half-order pair `(X⁹, X⁸)` has exactly `16 = n` bad scalars — the bad set is
the domain `μ₁₆` itself, field-independently (same at `p = 193`).**

The mechanism is fully transparent — **coset splitting**: on `μ₁₆`, `x⁸ = ±1` on the two
`μ₈`-cosets, so `x⁹ + λx⁸ = ±(x + λ)` is piecewise linear; a witness with six points on
one coset and the single crossing point `x` with `x = −λ`-cancellation on the other is
explained by the linear polynomial `±(X + λ)`, while neither row alone is explainable
there. This is the CS25/KK25-style splitting appearing as the take-over family below the
adjacent death radius.

This file machine-checks the kill:

* `census_16_4_7_empty` — the adjacent constrained census at `(16,4)`, `a = 7` over `F₉₇`
  is **empty** (kernel `decide` over all `C(16,7) = 11440` subsets — the O139/O141
  measurement, now a theorem at this instance).
* `event_lam1`, `event_lam8` — two explicit bad scalars for the `(X⁹, X⁸)` stack at the
  grid radius `1 − 7/16`, with explicit linear explanations (`96 + 96X`, `8 + X`) and the
  coset no-joint argument (a cubic agreeing with a constant on six points is that
  constant, and fails at the crossing point).
* `takeover_falsifies` — hence `ε_mca ≥ 2/97 > 1/97 = (census + 1)/|F|`:
  **`CensusUpperExtremalFloor` is false at `(16,4)` over `F₉₇` for every crossing
  `ac < 7`.**

**What survives, corrected.** The pin engine (`mcaDeltaStar_eq_of_censusCrossing`-family)
is agnostic to which census function is plugged in; `census_le_epsMCA` remains a valid
lower bound (now joined by the half-pair's). The corrected upper target must be stated
over the **excess census** — the bad-scalar counts of `(X^s, X^{s−1})` for all `s ≥ a`
(the agreement-matched `constrainedCensus` is the `s = a` slice; the take-over is the
`s = n/2 + 1` slice, with its own flat-`n` law). Formalizing the excess census law is the
census lane's next target; until then the campaign has **no standing upper-extremality
hypothesis**, and the honest δ* statement for this family is bracket-only.

All results are `sorry`-free and axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).
