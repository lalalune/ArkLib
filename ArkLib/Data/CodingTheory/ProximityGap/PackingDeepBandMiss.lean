# The packing bad-scalar bound provably misses the deep band (#389/#371)

The q-independent packing bound `mca_badscalar_packing` (`SinglePencilQIndependence.lean`) gives
`#bad ≤ C(n, k+1)/C(a, k+1)`, which at the deep band (`a = r+1`, `k+1 = r`, `n = 2m`, `r = m = n/2`)
reads `#bad ≤ C(2m, m)/(m+1)`.  The KKH26 supply budget there is `2^r·C(n/2, r) = 2^m`.  This file
machine-checks that the packing **upper bound strictly exceeds** that supply budget at the deep band:

> **`packing_exceeds_budget_deep_band`** — for `m ≥ 5`, `(m+1)·2^m < C(2m, m)`.

So the packing route cannot establish `CensusDomination` (`#bad ≤ supply`) at `r = n/2`.  This is the
machine-checked counterpart of `probe_packing_crossover.py`: the elementary q-independent route
covers only up to `r = Θ(√(n log n))` (the moment-method / window `1/log n` scale), and the deep band
`r ~ n/2` — the deployed prize window — is provably beyond it, i.e. the genuinely open core.

(The proven `mca_badscalar_packing` is correct and unaffected; this only delimits the radius range
its bound is strong enough to pin, correcting the `~3n/8` prose extrapolation to `Θ(√(n log n))`.)

/-- **The packing bound exceeds the supply budget at the deep band.** For `m ≥ 5`, the central
binomial `C(2m, m)` exceeds `(m+1)·2^m`, i.e. the packing upper bound `C(2m,m)/(m+1)` on the
bad-scalar count is strictly larger than the deep-band supply budget `2^m`.  Hence the elementary
`mca_badscalar_packing` route cannot establish `CensusDomination` at `r = n/2`, and the deep band
(the deployed prize window) is beyond its reach — the open core. -/

/-- **Positive coverage of the packing route below `√n`.** If `j·(j+3) ≤ 2N` for every `j < r`
(i.e. `r ≲ √(2N)`), the packing upper bound `C(2N,r)/(r+1)` is at most the supply budget
`2^r·C(N,r)`: precisely, `C(2N,r) ≤ (r+1)·2^r·C(N,r)`.  So the q-independent packing route proves
`CensusDomination` for `r` up to `Θ(√n)`.  Together with `packing_exceeds_budget_deep_band` (which
fails it at `r = n/2`), this **sandwiches** the elementary route's reach: covered for `r ≲ √n`,
missed at the deep band — the open core is exactly the band in between (`Θ(√(n log n))` ↔ `n/2`). -/
