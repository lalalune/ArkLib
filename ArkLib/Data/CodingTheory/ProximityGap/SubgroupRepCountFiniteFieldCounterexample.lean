# Round 9 (Issue #232, ABF26) — the char-0 minimal-energy bound DOES NOT transfer to `F_q` (verified).

`RootsOfUnityAdditiveEnergy` proved that in **characteristic 0** the roots of unity have minimal
additive energy, via the unit-circle fact that a nonzero `t` has at most `2` representations
`#{c : c, c+t both roots of unity} ≤ 2`. `AdditiveEnergyRepBound` then showed `repCount ≤ 2 ⟹ E ≤ 3|G|²`
over any field. The natural hope was to prove `repCount ≤ 2` for the `2^k`-subgroup over `F_q`.

**This file refutes that hope with an explicit verified counterexample.** Over `F₁₇` (`17 ≡ 1 mod 16`,
so the `8`-th roots of unity exist), the `8`-th roots are
`G = {1,2,4,8,9,13,15,16} = {±1,±2,±4,±8}`, and the nonzero shift `t = 1` has **three** representations:

> `repCount_F17_eighthRoots_eq_three`:  `#{c ∈ G : c + 1 ∈ G} = 3`,  witnessed by `c ∈ {1, 8, 15}`
> (the consecutive pairs `(1,2), (8,9), (15,16)` are all inside `G`).

So `repCount ≤ 2` is **false** over `F_q`: the char-0 minimal-additive-energy property of roots of unity
does **not** transfer to finite fields. The additive coincidences (here, three consecutive pairs inside
the subgroup) are a genuine `F_q` phenomenon with no characteristic-0 analogue — exactly the reason the
deep-interior δ* question is hard over `F_q`, and a sharp correction to the naive "smooth domains have
minimal additive energy" intuition: **they do in char 0, but not over `F_q`.** The honest open problem is
therefore the *true* (larger-than-`3|G|²`) sum-product additive-energy bound for `2^k`-subgroups over
`F_q`, not the char-0 value. All `sorry`-free and axiom-clean (the finite `F₁₇` facts are closed by
the kernel `decide`, not `native_decide`).

`8`-th roots of unity in `F₁₇`) and a nonzero `t` with `repCount = 3 > 2`. Hence the char-0
minimal-additive-energy argument (`RootsOfUnityAdditiveEnergy.unitCircle_reps_le_two`) genuinely does
**not** transfer to finite fields; the true `F_q` additive energy is the open sum-product quantity. -/
