/-! # Affine-decomposition descent (GS-kernel mathematics)

The abstract core of the "solution is linear in Z" step of the Guruswami–Sudan
list-correlated-agreement kernel (`solution_gamma_is_linear_in_Z`): a degree-`≤1`
polynomial whose coefficients descend along a ring homomorphism `φ : R →+* S`
is itself the `φ`-image of a degree-`≤1` polynomial over `R`. I.e. once the GS
power-series representative is shown polynomial of X-degree `≤ 1`, it has the
affine form `v₀ + X·v₁` with `v₀, v₁` pulled back along the coefficient embedding.
Fully general and standalone. -/

/-- **Affine descent.** If `p : S[X]` has `natDegree ≤ 1` and each coefficient
lies in the range of `φ : R →+* S`, then `p = q.map φ` for some `q : R[X]` with
`natDegree ≤ 1` (concretely `q = C b + C a * X` with `φ a = p.coeff 1`,
`φ b = p.coeff 0`). -/
