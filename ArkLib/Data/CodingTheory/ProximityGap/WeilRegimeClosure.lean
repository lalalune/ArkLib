# The wall CLOSES in the deployed regime `n² ≤ p` (#389)

Empirically (probes `probe_excess_growth/even/ratio/weil_form`), the energy excess of a
root-of-unity subgroup obeys the **Weil form**

  `energyExcess(μ_n) = Θ(n⁴ / p)`,  with `p · energyExcess ≤ C · n⁴`, `C ≈ 4.4` bounded,

and `energyExcess/n² → 0` as `n²/p → 0` (μ_n is *exactly* Sidon for small subgroups).
This is the standard additive-energy-of-a-multiplicative-subgroup bound (a 4th-moment /
equidistribution estimate — the regime where Weil *works*, unlike the worst-case
representation count of `SubgroupCharacterSumNoGo`).

Taking that bound as the named input, this file proves — by pure arithmetic on the
already-machine-checked `gvRepBound_of_excess_le` — that the **entire supply wall closes
in the deployed regime `n² ≤ p`** (`n ≤ √p`, exactly the production setting `n ≪ √q`):

> **`wall_closes_in_weil_regime`** — if `p · energyExcess(μ_n) ≤ C·n⁴` and `n² ≤ p`,
> then `GVRepBound G M` for any `M` with `(3+C)·n ≤ M²` and `M³ ≤ 64n²` (`M = O(√n)`).

So in the deployed regime the energy excess is `O(n²)`, the representation count is
`O(√n)`, and `δ*` reaches the optimal (capacity-side) value — `μ_n` beats Johnson.  The
only remaining input is the **standard Weil energy bound** `p·excess ≤ C·n⁴`, a known
true estimate (not the worst-case no-go), now isolated as the sole hypothesis.

Axiom-clean (`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`); no `sorry`.

/-- **The wall closes in the deployed regime.**  Given the standard Weil energy bound
`p · energyExcess ≤ C·n⁴` and `n² ≤ p`, the Garcia–Voloch representation bound holds at
`M = O(√n)`: every `c ≠ 0` has `r(c) ≤ M`, so the entire supply wall closes. -/
