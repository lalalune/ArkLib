# Rigidity: vanishing-statistic `h`-subsets are exactly cosets (Issue #232)

This is the **converse** to the coset construction of `CosetPowerSumConcentration.lean`. There we
showed that a coset `g·μ_h` of the order-`h` roots of unity kills all the elementary symmetric
functions `e_1, …, e_{h-1}` (its characteristic polynomial is `X^h - g^h`). Here we prove the
sharp converse:

* `all_pow_eq_of_esymm_zero` — if an `h`-element subset `S` of a field has `e_1(S) = … =
  e_{h-1}(S) = 0`, then **every** `x ∈ S` is an `h`-th root of one common constant `c`
  (`x^h = c`). Hence `S ⊆ {x : x^h = c}`, and since `|S| = h = deg(X^h - c)`, `S` is *exactly* the
  root set of `X^h - c` — a coset of `μ_h`.

**Consequence (the exact count at `a = h`).** Combined with the forward direction, the
vanishing-statistic `h`-subsets of the smooth domain `μ_n` are *exactly* the `n/h` cosets of the
order-`h` subgroup. So `CosetPowerSumConcentration.exists_many_vanishing_powersum_subsets` is not
merely a lower bound at `a = h`: the count `C(n/h, 1) = n/h` is **tight** — the coset construction
captures *all* of the concentration at the agreement level equal to the subgroup order. This
upgrades the `decide`-verified `μ_8` tightness witness (`N2(μ_8, 4, 0, 0) = 2`) to a theorem, and
it pins exactly why the coset method, while sharp here, cannot reach deeper: at `a = h` the only
vanishing-statistic subsets are the rigid cosets, leaving no extra freedom to push the depth.

The proof: the monic polynomial `P = ∏_{x∈S}(X - x)` has degree `h` (Vieta /
`natDegree_multiset_prod_X_sub_C_eq_card`); its coefficients `P.coeff k = (-1)^{h-k} e_{h-k}(S)`
vanish for `1 ≤ k ≤ h-1` by hypothesis, so evaluating at any root `x ∈ S` gives
`0 = P.eval x = P.coeff 0 + x^h`, i.e. `x^h = -P.coeff 0` — the same constant for every `x ∈ S`.

All results are `sorry`-free and axiom-clean.

/-- **Rigidity of vanishing-symmetric-function `h`-subsets.** If an `h`-element subset `S` of a
field has its first `h-1` elementary symmetric functions all zero, then every element of `S` is an
`h`-th root of one common constant `c`: `∃ c, ∀ x ∈ S, x^h = c`. Since `|S| = h = deg(X^h - c)`,
`S` is exactly the root set of `X^h - c` — a coset of the order-`h` roots of unity. The converse to
the coset construction: vanishing-statistic `h`-subsets are exactly the cosets. -/
