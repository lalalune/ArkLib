# Issue #141: honest partial progress on the open ABF26 Grand Challenge 1 prize surfaces

Issue #141 tracks the genuinely **open** ABF26 Grand Challenge 1 prize conjectures — the
beyond-UDR Guruswami–Sudan list-decoder mass bound at radius up to the Johnson/capacity bound
`1 - ρ - η`. The named `Prop`s carrying that open content are
`ProximityGap.GrandChallenges.mcaConjecture` (abstract `ε_mca` polynomial bound),
`ProximityGap.MCAGS.epsMCAgs_prizeBound_conjecture` /
`ProximityGap.MCAGS.uniformEpsMCAgsPrizeBoundConjecture` (GS-exposed forms), and
`ProximityGap.MCAGS.epsMCAgsPrizeUniversalConjecture` (field-universal GS form).

**Integrity.** This file adds *only* honest partial progress. It does **not** prove any open
conjecture, does **not** carry one as a `sorry`-backed theorem, and does **not** assume an
equivalent packaged form silently. Every genuinely open statement remains an explicit named
hypothesis on every theorem that consumes it. The new content here is:

1. **Unconditional special case of the conjecture's conclusion** in the trivial-bound regime
   (`epsMCA_le_mcaConjectureBound_of_one_le_bound`): wherever the conjectural RHS is `≥ 1`, the
   conclusion `ε_mca ≤ RHS` holds *unconditionally* because `ε_mca ≤ 1` always. This is the
   honest small-field / large-gap floor of the conjecture — no GS mass bound needed there.

2. **A faithful equivalence of surfaces** (`mcaConjecture_iff_abstractRSMcaPolyBound`): the
   abstract polynomial-bound surface `AbstractRSMcaPolyBound` is *exactly* `mcaConjecture` (a
   definitional bidirectional reduction), with explicit intro/elim rules. This certifies the
   packaged surface adds no hidden slack — it is the same open content, repackaged for reuse.

3. **A genuine new conditional reduction** (`nonempty_mcaLowerWitness_of_universalGSPrize`)
   threading the *open* field-universal GS prize through to the in-tree one-sided Grand-MCA
   progress framework (`MCALowerWitness`): under the open prize (an explicit hypothesis), every
   prize-rate radius whose GS mass bound clears `ε*` yields a one-sided lower witness pinning the
   maximal Grand-MCA threshold `δ*`. The open conjecture stays a hypothesis; the abstract
   `ε_mca ≤ bound` is supplied by the already-proved `MCAGS.epsMCA_le_of_universalGSConjecture`.

All theorems below are `sorry`-free and depend only on the standard axioms
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (see the `#print axioms` audit at the end), *except*
where they explicitly take an open conjecture as a hypothesis — in which case that hypothesis is
the only non-standard input and is visible in the signature.

/-! ## (1) Unconditional special case: the conjecture's conclusion in the trivial-bound regime

The §4.5 conjecture asserts `ε_mca(RS, δ) ≤ mcaConjectureBound …`. Since `ε_mca ≤ 1` *always*
(`epsMCA_le_one`), the conclusion is unconditionally true on any radius where the conjectural RHS
is already `≥ 1`. This is the honest floor of the conjecture: at small field size `q` or large
gap `η = 1 - ρ - δ` the polynomial bound `(1/q)·n^{c₁}/(ρ^{c₂}·η^{c₃})` exceeds `1`, and there the
prize content (the beyond-UDR GS list-decoder mass bound) is *not* needed. The open territory is
exactly where this bound drops below `1`. -/

/-- **Special case (unconditional): the §4.5 conjecture conclusion holds wherever the bound is
`≥ 1`.** No GS list-decoder mass bound is required: `ε_mca ≤ 1 ≤ mcaConjectureBound` directly.
This bounds the open prize's content to the sub-`1` regime of the conjectural RHS. -/

/-! ## (2) A faithful equivalence of surfaces

`AbstractRSMcaPolyBound` is a re-statement of the §4.5 abstract polynomial bound as a standalone
named `Prop`. The equivalence `mcaConjecture_iff_abstractRSMcaPolyBound` (a *definitional* `Iff`)
certifies it carries exactly the same open content — no hidden strengthening, no hidden slack —
giving downstream developments clean intro/elim rules without risking laundering the prize. -/

/-- **Packaged form of the §4.5 abstract MCA polynomial bound.** A named `Prop`: a universal
constant triple `(c₁, c₂, c₃)` bounding `ε_mca(RS, δ)` by `mcaConjectureBound` for every RS code
and every sub-`(1-ρ)` radius. This is the abstract-`ε_mca` surface downstream developments may
consume; the equivalence below shows it is *exactly* `mcaConjecture`. -/

  ∃ c₁ c₂ c₃ : ℝ,
    ∀ {ιC : Type} [Fintype ιC] [Nonempty ιC] [DecidableEq ιC]
      {FC : Type} [Field FC] [Fintype FC] [DecidableEq FC]
      (domain : ιC ↪ FC) (k : ℕ) (δ : ℝ≥0),

        ENNReal.ofReal

/-- The packaged abstract bound is **definitionally** the §4.5 conjecture: a bidirectional
reduction confirming the two surfaces are not redundant restatements with hidden slack. The open
prize content is preserved exactly. -/

    mcaConjecture ↔ AbstractRSMcaPolyBound := Iff.rfl

/-- **Introduction rule for `mcaConjecture`.** Any proof of the packaged abstract polynomial
bound is a proof of the §4.5 conjecture (still open; this is just the surface conversion). -/
theorem mcaConjecture_of_abstractRSMcaPolyBound (h : AbstractRSMcaPolyBound) :

/-- **Elimination rule for `mcaConjecture`.** The §4.5 conjecture yields the packaged abstract
polynomial bound, for downstream developments that prefer the named-surface form. -/

/-! ## (3) New conditional reduction: open GS prize ⇒ prize-rate MCA lower witnesses

This threads the genuinely-open field-universal Guruswami–Sudan prize
(`MCAGS.epsMCAgsPrizeUniversalConjecture`) through to the in-tree one-sided Grand-MCA progress
framework (`MCALowerWitness`). The open prize stays an explicit hypothesis; the abstract
`ε_mca ≤ bound` step is the already-proved `MCAGS.epsMCA_le_of_universalGSConjecture`. The payoff:
under the prize, every prize-rate radius whose GS mass bound clears `ε*` pins the maximal
Grand-MCA threshold `δ*` from below (via `MCALowerWitness.le_δStar`). -/

/-- **Open GS prize ⇒ prize-rate MCA lower witnesses.** Under the field-universal Guruswami–Sudan
prize (`MCAGS.epsMCAgsPrizeUniversalConjecture m`, an explicit hypothesis), for the exposed
constants and every field/domain/prize-rate/gap/radius with `δ ≤ 1 - ρ - η`, `δ ≤ 1`, and the
`epsMCAgsPrizeBound` clearing `ε*`, the RS code admits an `MCALowerWitness` at `δ`.

The open conjecture is *not* proved here — it is consumed as a hypothesis. This is the honest
bridge from the open GS prize surface to one-sided Grand-MCA progress. -/

/-! ## Source / axiom audit

The unconditional progress lemmas are axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).
The conditional reductions additionally rest only on their explicit open-conjecture hypotheses;
they introduce no `sorry` and no extra axioms. The open ABF26 Grand Challenge 1 prize conjectures
remain unproven named hypotheses. -/
