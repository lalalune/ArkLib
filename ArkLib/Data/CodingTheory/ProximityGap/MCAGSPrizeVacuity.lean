# Anti-vacuity guard for the GS-exposed prize: the list family must be faithful (#121 / #141 / #171)

The GS-exposed Grand-Challenge-1 prize statements (`GrandChallenge141PrizeMath.lean`,
`MCAGS.lean`) bound `epsMCAgs C δ L` and always carry a **`FaithfulGSFamily`** hypothesis on the
list family `L`. This file proves *why that hypothesis is mathematically indispensable*: without
it, the `∃ L, epsMCAgs C δ L ≤ …` form is **vacuous** and proves nothing about the actual MCA error.

`epsMCAgs C δ L = ⨆ u, Pr_γ[mcaEventGSrow (L u) …]`, and `mcaEventGSrow` requires its line-witness
codeword to lie in `L u`. Taking `L u = ∅` therefore kills every bad event:

* `mcaEventGSrow_emptyList_false` — the GS-row event is impossible against the empty list.
* `epsMCAgs_emptyList_eq_zero` — hence `epsMCAgs C δ (fun _ => ∅) = 0`.
* `exists_list_epsMCAgs_le` — hence for *any* target `B`, `∃ L, epsMCAgs C δ L ≤ B` holds (via
  `L = ∅`). So a prize claim of the bare `∃ L` shape is content-free; the genuine content lives
  entirely in the faithfulness constraint (`epsMCA ≤ epsMCAgs`, i.e. `FaithfulGSFamily`), which
  forbids the empty (and any under-covering) list. The abstract `GrandChallenges.mcaConjecture`
  avoids the issue by bounding `epsMCA` directly.

This is an anti-vacuity guard (cf. #121): it certifies that the GS-exposed prize is not trivially
satisfiable and that its faithfulness hypothesis cannot be dropped. A structural/negative result,
not a closure of the open prize. Tracking: Issues #121, #141, #171.
