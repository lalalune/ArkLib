# Factorization Rigidity (proximity-prize δ* optimality core, #407)

The two faces of the lemma `∏_{z∈S}(X-z)` is `m`-sparse ⟺ `S` is a union of cosets of `μ_m`,
the machinery that reduces the Kambiré-construction optimality (the δ* lower bracket) to known
polynomial-in-`Xᵐ` structure.  Both faces are proved here, axiom-clean, from `Polynomial.expand`.

/-- **Factorization rigidity — support face.** A polynomial is in the image of `expand R m`
(a polynomial in `Xᵐ`, i.e. "`m`-sparse": supported only on degrees divisible by `m`) **iff**
its support lies in the multiples of `m`. -/

/-- **Factorization rigidity — root face.** If `f = g(Xᵐ)` is a polynomial in `Xᵐ` and `ω` is an
`m`-th root of unity, then the root set of `f` is closed under multiplication by `ω`. Hence the
agreement set of an `m`-sparse near-codeword `Xᵃ + γXᵇ − c` (`a,b` multiples of `m`) is a union of
cosets of `μ_m` — the structural input that turns the bad-scalar count into the subgroup sumset. -/
