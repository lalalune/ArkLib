# Issue #232 — Lam–Leung at the prime 2: vanishing sums of 2-power roots of unity

The classical base case of the O48 tower theorem (DISPROOF_LOG O47–O48), machine-checked:
**in characteristic zero, a subset of the `2^(m+1)`-th roots of unity with vanishing sum
is closed under negation** — equivalently, it is a disjoint union of antipodal pairs
`{x, −x}`. This is the prime-2 instance of Lam–Leung's theorem on vanishing sums of roots
of unity [LamLeung2000], and the engine is Gauss: the `2^(m+1)`-th cyclotomic polynomial
`X^(2^m) + 1` is the rational minimal polynomial of a primitive root, so the indicator
polynomial of the exponent set is divisible by it, which pairs the coefficients at `i` and
`i + 2^m` — and `ζ^(2^m) = −1`.

Consequences wired elsewhere: this discharges the `hLL`/`hLL'` hypotheses of
`TopLine.t2_tower_resolution` (the descent assembly of the tower theorem), making the
`t = 2` exhaustiveness — and, iterated, the full tower theorem and its `2^{O(1/η)}`
deep-interior fiber bound — unconditional over characteristic-zero fields (and over `F_p`
above the O49 effective transfer threshold).

/-! ## The FULL tower theorem, unconditional, machine-checked

The complete O48 induction — with no Newton identities (the rung condition transfers
through the fiber structure in power-sum form: `∑_{x∈S} x^d = d·∑_{image} y`): in
characteristic zero, a finite set of `2^M`-th roots of unity whose power sums `p_j`
vanish for `1 ≤ j < 2^s` is closed under multiplication by every `2^s`-th root of
unity — **a union of `μ_{2^s}`-cosets**. (Power-sum and elementary-symmetric vanishing
define the same fiber in characteristic zero; the power-sum window is also exactly the
syndrome of the all-ones error on `S`.) At window scale `t = 2^s − 1 = Θ(ηn)` this pins
the fiber to coset unions, count `≤ 2^{n/2^s} = 2^{O(1/η)}` — the KK25/S-two budget. -/

/-- **The prize-shaped count corollary**: the number of `w`-subsets of a `2^M`-torsion
domain with vanishing power-sum window `1 ≤ j < 2^s` is at most `2^(#image)` where
`#image` is the number of `2^s`-th-power classes of the domain — for `D₀ = μ_n` this is
`2^(n/2^s)`, i.e. `2^{O(1/η)}` at window scale `t = 2^s − 1 = Θ(ηn)`: the KK25/S-two
budget, as a kernel-checked counting statement. Mechanism: by `full_tower` each such `S`
is `μ_{2^s}`-closed, hence exactly recoverable from its `2^s`-th-power image
(`S = D₀.filter (x ↦ x^{2^s} ∈ image)`), so the family injects into the subsets of the
power-class space. -/

/-! ## General received words: the syndrome fold identity and the cancellation dichotomy

The entry point for the all-words quantifier (S-two Conjecture 1): a general weight-`w`
error (support `S`, values `v`) has power-sum syndrome `p_j = ∑_{x∈S} v(x)·x^j`, and its
EVEN syndrome coordinates are exactly the syndrome of the **folded** error — values
summed over squaring fibers — one level down the 2-adic tower:

    `p_{2j}(v, S) = p_j(fold v, S²)`,   `(fold v)(y) = ∑_{x² = y} v(x)`.

This is the FRI folding identity on the error side, in the same `synd`-style framework
as O44–O55. The all-ones error has `fold v ≡ (fiber size) ≠ 0`, which is why the tower
theorem (O53) closes unconditionally there; for general `v` the *only* obstruction to
descending is **fold-cancellation** (`fold v = 0` at some image point) — making precise,
in formal language, where all-words list mass can hide, and converging with the
C19/descent-lane anatomy from the protocol side. -/

Completing the general-word descent step: a window-vanishing valued error `(S, v)`
descends to TWO folded systems — the even fold (`syndrome_fold`) and the odd fold
(`syndrome_fold_odd` below, values `∑_{x²=y} v(x)·x`) — and the support can at most halve
(`sq_image_card`: squaring fibers have size ≤ 2). Under no-cancellation both folds are
genuine errors of half-scale weight with halved windows: the quantitative valued
descent, every piece machine-checked. The cancellation locus (some fold value = 0)
remains the exact home of S-two Conjecture 1. -/

/-! ## Branch-mass conservation: the first unconditional all-words descent inequality

The O57 observation as theorems: at any squared point, the even and odd folds cannot both
vanish unless the error is zero on the whole fiber (`fold_mass_conservation`) — so for a
genuine error every fiber feeds at least one branch, and the total folded weight is at
least half the original weight (`branch_mass_inequality`):

    `|S| ≤ 2·(|supp(fold_even)| + |supp(fold_odd)|)`.

This is an UNCONDITIONAL statement about ALL valued errors — the first all-words descent
inequality of the program: window-vanishing mass descends with at most a factor-2 weight
loss per level, split between the two branches. Iterated, the all-words list question
becomes branch-accounting over the tower (the C19/descent object), now with its
conservation law machine-checked. -/

The complement to branch-mass conservation (O58): a genuine valued error whose power
sums vanish on the full initial window `j < t` must have support size `> t` — the
`t × |S|` Vandermonde system on distinct points has trivial kernel. Combined with O58
and the fold identities (O56/O57), the descent bookkeeping is complete: every branch
of the tower keeps a window, hence keeps weight, hence the branch tree stays wide —
the quantitative branch-accounting question is now pinched between two machine-checked

The last internal seam of the pipeline: the syndrome-side results (O44–O46, esymm form)
and the tower results (O53–O59, power-sum form) describe the same fibers. Both
directions are DIRECT consequences of the instantiated Newton recurrence — every cross
term of `p_k = ±k·e_k − Σ (±e_a·p_{k−a})` carries a factor with index strictly inside
the window, so window vanishing on either side collapses the recurrence to its diagonal
term. `esymm → psum` is characteristic-free; `psum → esymm` divides by `k`
(characteristic zero). -/

The O56/O57 even/odd fold is the `d = 2` case of a complete `d`-ary decomposition: for
every residue `r < d`, the syndrome coordinates `p_{dj+r}` of a valued error are the
syndrome coordinates of the `r`-twisted fold `(fold_r v)(y) = ∑_{x^d=y} v(x)·x^r` one
level down the `d`-th-power map. This extends the entire descent toolkit beyond 2-adic
towers to MIXED-RADIX smooth domains — in particular toward the Mersenne-31/Circle-STARK
domains of S-two's own deployment, whose tower is not 2-power. -/

/-! ## Lam–Leung at every prime power: the mixed-radix base case

The general-prime version of `vanishing_sum_antipodal` (which is the `p = 2` instance):
in characteristic zero, a finite set of `p^(m+1)`-th roots of unity with vanishing sum is
closed under multiplication by every `p`-th root of unity — a union of `μ_p`-cosets.
Engine: `Φ_{p^(m+1)} = Σ_{i<p} X^{i·p^m}` (Gauss + the prime-power cyclotomic formula)
divides the exponent-indicator polynomial, and a multiple `G·R` of the geometric packet
with `deg R < p^m` has ALL `p` of its `p^m`-length coefficient slices equal to `R` —
so membership is invariant under exponent shifts by `p^m`, i.e. under `μ_p`. This is the
base case for mixed-radix smooth towers (the O65 general-radix fold supplies the
matching descent identities). -/

/-! ## The coefficient-general slice theorem: the de Bruijn engine

Upgrading the O66 machinery from subset indicators to ARBITRARY ℚ-coefficients: any
vanishing ℚ-linear combination of `p^(m+1)`-th roots of unity has all `p` of its
coefficient slices equal. This is exactly the engine the two-prime (de Bruijn) induction
needs: the CRT double-slice argument applies this theorem at one prime with coefficients
in the other prime's cyclotomic field, and the slice DIFFERENCES it produces carry
`{−1,0,1}` coefficients — outside the subset world, inside this one. -/

/-! ## The complete ℚ-kernel at 2-power level: vanishing ⟺ antipodal symmetry

The coefficient-slice theorem (O68) upgraded to a full characterization at `p = 2`:
a ℚ-coefficient combination of `2^(m+1)`-th roots of unity vanishes **iff** its
coefficient function is antipodally symmetric (`c(e) = c(e + 2^m)`). Necessity is the
slice theorem; sufficiency is `ζ^(2^m) = −1` pairing terms to zero. Corollary: any
combination with an UNPAIRED support point is nonzero — the sparse-nonvanishing bound
that forces branch data in the descent tree (a branch whose window pins it to an
asymmetric configuration is impossible; leaf data is rigid). -/

/-! ## The valued 2-power windowed law: window-invariance modulo `2^(m−k)`

The multiplicity-door base case of the valued-fold frontier: a ℚ-coefficient vector on
`μ_{2^(m+1)}`-exponents whose 2-power window `{2^0, …, 2^k}` vanishes is invariant on
exponent classes modulo `2^(m−k)` — the valued analogue of `full_tower`. Induction on
`k`: the `j = 0` relation gives antipodal symmetry (O74), under which the folded vector
`c₁(s) = c(s) + c(s + 2^m) = 2·c(s)` inherits the shallower window at the halved level;
the inductive congruence-invariance of `c₁` pulls back through the antipodal reduction.
For integer multiplicity vectors (contracted folds of windowed sets, branch-weight
profiles) this pins the structure completely at 2-power levels. -/

/-! ## Contracted multiplicity rigidity: the branch program's first formal constraint

The O125 valued law applied to fold multiplicities: for a windowed subset of
`μ_{2^(m+1)}`, the fiber-count function of the `2^s`-power contraction is an INTEGER
vector inheriting the window at scaled exponents — hence coset-constant by the valued
law. Branch-weight profiles of windowed sets down the 2-adic tower are RIGID: at every
depth, the multiplicity a windowed set lays over the contracted domain is invariant on
`μ`-coset classes. This is the first machine-checked structural constraint the program
places on the branch-count objects themselves. -/

O126 at depth `s = 0`: the indicator of a subset is its own depth-0 multiplicity
vector, so the rigidity law applies — and yields `full_tower`'s coset-union conclusion
from ONLY the 2-power window `{2^0, …, 2^k}` (`k+1` exponents) instead of the full
window `[1, 2^(k+1))` (`2^(k+1) − 1` exponents): the original pillar of the session,
strengthened exponentially in hypothesis by its newest theorem. -/
