# Round 11 (Issue #232, ABF26) — the EXACT additive energy of a concrete smooth `F_q` subgroup.

`RootsOfUnityAdditiveEnergy` proved the char-0 minimum `E(S) ≤ 3|S|²` (roots of unity, maximal
anti-concentration). `AdditiveEnergyRepBound` reduced the finite-field side to the representation
bound `repCount ≤ 2`, and `SubgroupRepCountFiniteFieldCounterexample` showed that bound **fails** over
`F_q` (the shift `t = 1` has `3` representations in the order-8 subgroup of `F₁₇`). This file closes
the concrete loop by computing the **exact** additive energy of that same explicit subgroup:

> `additiveEnergy_F17_eighthRoots_eq`:  `E(G) = 264`  for `G = {1,2,4,8,9,13,15,16} ⊆ F₁₇` (the
> order-8 multiplicative subgroup = 8-th roots of unity), by `decide`.

The value sits **strictly between** the char-0 minimum and the trivial maximum:

> `char0_minimum_lt`:  `3·|G|² = 192 < 264 = E(G)`  (the finite-field energy EXCEEDS the char-0
>   minimum — a quantitative witness that the roots-of-unity anti-concentration is **lost** over `F_q`,
>   matching the `repCount = 3 > 2` counterexample), and
> `lt_trivial_maximum`: `E(G) = 264 < 512 = |G|³`  (it is still far from the maximal-concentration
>   degenerate value).

So for this explicit prize-faithful smooth instance the additive energy is a concrete number in the
open band `(3|G|², |G|³)`; the prize regime's question is exactly *where in that band* the energy of
the `2^k`-subgroup lands as `|G|, q → ∞` (the open Weil/sum-product input). `sorry`-free, axiom-clean.
