# The black-box form of ABF26 Theorem 4.21 is *false* (statement-level refutation)

`ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/LineDecoding.lean` carries the named target proposition
`lineDecodable_imp_epsMCA_le_target`, whose docstring (the "WALL" note) explains that the
*counting reduction* of GG25 / ABF26 Theorem 4.21 cannot close the goal for a black-box
proximity parameter `a` and an unconstrained radius `δ`, and that the faithful route needs a
Guruswami–Sudan statement repair.

This file proves the stronger fact that the conclusion of `lineDecodable_imp_epsMCA_le_target` does
**not** follow from its hypothesis at all: there is a concrete instance where the code is
`(δ, a, n+1)`-line-decodable yet `ε_mca(C, δ) > a / |F|`. Hence the target theorem is **not a
theorem as stated** — it requires a hypothesis repair (a proximity bound on `δ`, e.g.
`δ < (n-1)/n`, together with a nondegeneracy bound such as `1 ≤ a` or `2 ≤ n`), not merely a
cleverer leaf proof. The existing `sorry` therefore cannot be honestly discharged.

## The witness

Take `ι = Fin 1` (so `n = |ι| = 1`), `F = A = ZMod 2`, the **zero code** `C = ⊥` (whose
underlying set is `{0}`), `δ = 0`, and `a = 0`.

* **Line-decodability holds vacuously-strongly.** Any `U : F → ι → A` valued in `C = {0}`
  satisfies `U γ = 0` for all `γ`, so for the affine pair `(u₁, u₂) = (0, 0) ∈ C²` we have
  `U γ = 0 = u₁ + γ • u₂` for every `γ`; thus `Pr_γ[U γ = u₁ + γ • u₂] = 1 ≥ (n+1)/|F| = 2/2`.
  The conclusion of `LineDecodable` is *always* satisfiable here, independently of the
  hypothesis, so `LineDecodable C δ a (n+1)` holds.

* **`ε_mca` is strictly positive.** The stack `u 0 = 0`, `u 1 = 1` (the all-ones word of
  `Fin 1 → ZMod 2`) fires `mcaEvent` at `γ = 0`: the witness set `S = {0}` has
  `|S| = 1 ≥ (1-δ)·n = 1`, the zero codeword `w = 0` equals the line `u 0 + 0 • u 1 = 0` on
  `S`, and **no** codeword pair from `C = {0}` agrees with `(u 0, u 1) = (0, 1)` on `S`
  (any pair is `(0,0)` and `0 ≠ 1` at position `0`), so `¬ pairJointAgreesOn`. Hence
  `Pr_γ[mcaEvent] ≥ Pr[γ = 0] = 1/|F| > 0 = a / |F|`, and `ε_mca(C, δ) ≥ 1/|F| > a/|F|`.

The single shared "miss" of the WALL counterexample is realised here geometrically: at the
only nonzero coordinate the affine `g₀(γ) = (u₁-f₁)₀ + γ·(u₂-f₂)₀ = -(1)·γ` is identically
constrained by no second equation, so the line-decoder's `n+1`-budget — which only sees the
trivially-aligned zero pair — never pins the bad coordinate. This is exactly the off-by-one /
no-proximity-bound obstruction described in `LineDecoding.lean`.
