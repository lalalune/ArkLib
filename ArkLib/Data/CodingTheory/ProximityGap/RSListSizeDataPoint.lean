  Empirical list-size data point for the Ethereum Proximity Prize (ABF26, eprint 2026/680).

  We instantiate an explicit smooth-domain Reed-Solomon code and compute, by kernel `decide`
  (NOT `native_decide`), the EXACT list-decoding list sizes at several agreement radii, locating
  the threshold crossing through the open Johnson-to-capacity gap.

  Setup.
    * Field            F  = ZMod 17        (note 8 | 17 - 1, so the 8th roots of unity live in F).
    * Smooth domain    D  = mu_8 ⊂ Fˣ      (the 8th roots of unity, a power-of-two subgroup), n = 8.
    * Code             RS = { evaluations of polynomials of degree < 2 } = degree-<2 codewords.
    * Rate             rho = k / n = 2 / 8 = 1/4,  so sqrt(rho) = 1/2.

  In RELATIVE-DISTANCE coordinates the gap of interest is (1 - sqrt(rho), 1 - rho) = (1/2, 3/4),
  which in AGREEMENT coordinates a = (1 - delta)·n is the open interval ( rho·n , sqrt(rho)·n ) = ( 2 , 4 ):

        capacity agreement  a = 2   <   INTERIOR  a = 3   <   Johnson agreement  a = 4.

  The exact GLOBAL-worst-case max list sizes (found by exhaustive/heavy search, witnessed below) are

        a = 2 :  28        a = 3 :  7        a = 4 :  2        a = 5 :  1.

  The crossing sits in the OPEN gap: at the interior radius a = 3 the list size is a small constant
  (7), i.e. the code is genuinely list-decodable strictly beyond the Johnson radius and toward
  capacity for this concrete smooth-domain instance — a verified `delta*` data point.

  Every theorem below is closed by kernel `decide`; the file imports only Mathlib and is axiom-clean
  (`#print axioms` lists only the standard `propext / Classical.choice / Quot.sound`).

/-! ## Witness word at the Johnson agreement radius `a = 4`

`wJ` is the received word that is the zero codeword on the first four coordinates and the identity
codeword `x` on the last four; it lies at the Johnson radius and its list there has size exactly 2
