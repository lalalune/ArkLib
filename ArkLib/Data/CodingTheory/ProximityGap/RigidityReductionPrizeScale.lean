# The rigidity reduction: char-`p` far-line incidence = char-`0` incidence at prize scale (#407)

This is the conceptual **keystone** of the δ* program's char-independence claim, stated and proved
*honestly* with the one unformalized link (the Galois-divisibility input) carried as a named
hypothesis.

## The setup (governing law, in-tree)

For a monomial pencil `(a,b)` the far-line incidence is
`I(δ) = #{α : x^a + α x^b is δ-close to RS[k]}` (the bad-α count); `δ* = sup{δ : I(δ) ≤ q·ε* ≈ n}`
(`OrbitCountCrossingLaw`, `MCAThresholdLedger.mcaDeltaStar`). We compare:

* `I_0(δ)` — the count computed over a **characteristic-0** field (`ℚ(ζ_n) ⊆ ℂ`), where "`δ`-close"
  is decided by *exact* vanishing of integer/cyclotomic readouts; and
* `I_p(δ)` — the same count over the prize field `F_q`, `char F_q = p`, where vanishing is decided
  **mod `p`**.

Reduction mod `p` only ever *creates* coincidences (`x ≡ 0` in `ℤ ⟹ x ≡ 0` mod `p`), so the bad set
in char `0` always injects into the bad set in char `p`: `B_0 ⊆ B_p`, hence `I_0 ≤ I_p`. The keystone
asks for the **reverse**: at prize scale `B_p = B_0`, so `I_p = I_0` and `δ*` is char-INDEPENDENT,
collapsing the prize to the single `q`-free char-0 incidence law.

## The mechanism, and what closes the gap

An index `α ∈ B_p \ B_0` is a *char-`p`-only* bad config: a readout that vanishes mod `p` but **not**
over `ℂ`. Such a vanishing forces a nonzero rational integer `N` (the field norm of the readout, a
product of `≤ φ(n)` conjugates) to satisfy `p^r ∣ N` for the rigidity rank `r` (the number of
simultaneously-vanishing conjugate conditions), with `|N| ≤ B := (2k)^{2k}` by the archimedean
triangle/product bound (`BadPrimeNormBound`). If `B < p^r`, no such `N` exists, so `B_p \ B_0 = ∅`.

* For the **full odd system** `r = k/2`, the size bound `(2k)^{2k} < p^{k/2}` is *equivalent* to
  `(2k)^4 < p` (`charPexcessFree_iff_prizeThreshold`), which **holds at prize scale**
  (`prize_charPexcessFree`, numeric `(2^30)^4 = 2^120 < q = 2^158`). So the reduction CLOSES for the
  full system: `I_p = I_0` (`incidence_charIndependent_fullSystem`).

* For a **single low-`r` readout** (`r = 1`) the requirement degrades to `(2k)^{2k} < p`, which is
  astronomically larger than the prize field and is **NOT** met. This is not a defect of the proof:
  it is the *exact* boundary recorded in `DISPROOF_LOG.md` (2026-06-14) — at `n = 32` the single
  `deg-3` readout `h_3` has a genuine char-`p` excess prime `p = 206889121 = n^{5.525}` (prize-scale,
  `≡ 1 mod 32`), so single-condition char-faithfulness is **REFUTED** at the prize point. The
  dichotomy `r = k/2` (rigid → closes) vs `r = 1` (floppy → wall) is therefore *honestly* the scope
  of this file (`single_readout_threshold_not_prize`).

## Honest scope: PROVEN here vs. NAMED hypothesis

**Proven (axiom-clean):**
* `no_charPOnly_witness` — the arithmetic core: `B < p^r ⟹` no integer `N ≠ 0` with `p^r ∣ N`,
  `|N| ≤ B` (i.e. `CharPOnlyWitness p r B` is empty).
* `badSet_eq_of_charPexcessFree` / `incidence_eq_of_charPexcessFree` — the abstract reduction: from
  `B_0 ⊆ B_p`, the per-excess-element witness package, and `B < p^r`, conclude `B_p = B_0` and
  `#B_p = #B_0` (`I_p = I_0`).
* `charPexcessFree_iff_prizeThreshold` — the `r = k/2` size bridge `(2k)^{2k} < p^{k/2} ⟺ (2k)^4 < p`
  (k even, k > 0).
* `prize_charPexcessFree`, `incidence_charIndependent_fullSystem` — the prize-scale instantiation.
* `single_readout_threshold_not_prize` — the honest negative half: the `r = 1` threshold `(2k)^{2k}`
  exceeds the prize field, so this reduction does **not** apply to single readouts (consistent with
  the `DISPROOF_LOG` n=32 excess prime).

**Named hypothesis (NOT formalized here — the Galois-divisibility input):** that every char-`p`-only
bad index `α ∈ B_p \ B_0` actually *produces* a `CharPOnlyWitness p r B` (a nonzero integer norm `N`
with `p^r ∣ N`, `|N| ≤ B`). This is the cyclotomic-norm / `Algebra.norm` half (`RootSumNorm` carries
the `|N| ≤ card^{finrank}` archimedean side; producing `N` and `p^r ∣ N` from `r` vanishing
conjugates needs the full `NumberField` machinery). It is carried as the explicit hypothesis `hwit`,
exactly the project's modularity convention.

/-! ### The char-`p`-only witness: the named Galois-divisibility package -/

/-- A **char-`p`-only witness** at rigidity rank `r` and size bound `B`: a nonzero rational integer
`N` (the field norm of the char-`p`-only-vanishing readout) divisible by `p^r` with `|N| ≤ B`.

This is precisely the divisibility input the elementary `BadPrimeNormBound` file does *not* reprove
(see that module's docstring): producing `N` from a cyclotomic norm and `p^r ∣ N` from `r` vanishing
conjugates needs `NumberField`/`Algebra.norm` machinery. Here it is the named hypothesis that a
char-`p`-only bad index supplies. The point of this file is that such a witness **cannot exist** once
`B < p^r`.  The data are `N` (the rational-integer field norm of the readout), `N ≠ 0` (it does *not*
vanish over `ℂ`), `p^r ∣ N` (from `r` vanishing conjugates mod `p`), and `|N| ≤ B` (the archimedean
triangle/product bound, `B = (2k)^{2k}`). -/

  `CharPOnlyWitness p r B`, and
* `hPB : B < p^r` — the prize-scale size gap,

then the char-`p` bad set equals the char-0 bad set: `Bp = B0`. The extra (char-`p`-only) elements
would each force a witness that `hPB` forbids. -/

p` to the power `k/2`, using `(2k)^{2k} = ((2k)^4)^{k/2}` when `k` is even. Backward: if `(2k)^4 ≥ p`
then `(2k)^{2k} = ((2k)^4)^{k/2} ≥ p^{k/2}`.) -/

/-! ### Prize-scale instantiation -/

/-- **Prize-scale char-`p`-excess-freeness (PROVEN).** At the prize point `n = 2^30`, `k = n/2 =
2^29`, full odd system `r = k/2`, the size gap `(2k)^{2k} < p^{k/2}` holds for any prime `p` reaching
prize field scale (concretely any `p ≥ q = n·2^128 = 2^158`), because `(2k)^4 = (2^30)^4 = 2^120 < q`.
This is `BadPrimeNormBound.prize_scale_no_bad_prime` fed through the size bridge. -/

/-- **THE KEYSTONE (PROVEN, axiom-clean modulo the named Galois-divisibility input).** At prize scale
(`p` reaching the prize field size), for the **full odd system** `r = k/2` with `k = 2^29`, the
char-`p` far-line incidence equals the char-0 incidence: `I_p = I_0`. The only non-elementary input
is `hwit` (each char-`p`-only bad index supplies a cyclotomic-norm witness), carried explicitly. The
size gap is discharged unconditionally by `prize_charPexcessFree`. This collapses the prize to the
single `q`-free char-0 incidence law. -/

/-! ### The honest negative half: the reduction does NOT apply to single readouts -/

/-- **Honest scope boundary (PROVEN).** For a *single* low-degree readout the rigidity rank is `r =
1`, so the char-`p`-excess-free size gap degrades to `(2k)^{2k} < p`. At the prize point `k = 2^29`,
the threshold `(2k)^{2k} = (2^30)^{2^30}` is astronomically larger than the prize field `q = 2^158`,
so the gap is **NOT** met: the reduction provides *no* char-independence for single readouts. This is
not a weakness of the argument — it is the exact boundary recorded in `DISPROOF_LOG.md` (2026-06-14):
at `n = 32` the single deg-3 readout `h_3` has a genuine prize-scale char-`p` excess prime
`p = 206889121 = n^{5.525}`. The rigid (`r = k/2`) vs floppy (`r = 1`) dichotomy is real. -/
