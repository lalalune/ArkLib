# Issue #407 (T3) — the odd-moment law: no odd-length all-positive vanishing sum of `2^k`-th roots

**Target.** In characteristic zero, **every vanishing multiset of `2^k`-th roots of unity has
even cardinality**. Equivalently: there is *no odd-length all-positive (multiplicity-one
weighted) vanishing sum of `2^μ`-th roots of unity*.

**Why this is the T3 core.** The worst incomplete Gauss sum / additive-energy programme studies
the period power sums `T_{2k+1} = Σ_{b≠0} S_b^{2k+1}`. Expanding `S_b^{2k+1}` over the dyadic
subgroup `μ_n` (`n = 2^μ`) collects, at each `b`, the count of `(2k+1)`-tuples of `μ_n`-elements
summing to zero — an **odd-length all-positive vanishing sum**. The structure theorem of
Lam–Leung at the prime 2 says every vanishing sum of `2^μ`-th roots is a `ℕ`-combination of the
two-term antipodal relations `x + (-x) = 0`
(`LamLeungMultisetAntipodal.count_antipodal_of_sum_eq_zero`: `count z = count (-z)`).
Antipodal pairing forces **even** length, since `-z ≠ z` for any root of
unity of order `> 1`. Hence `T_{2k+1} = 0` has no genuine (multiplicity-positive) contributors of
odd length, which is the char-0 input to the odd-moment law `Σ_i η_i^{2k+1} = -n^{2k}`.

**This brick is character-sum-free and combinatorial** — it does NOT touch the BGK worst-incomplete
-Gauss-sum wall (that wall is about the *even* moments `E_r` / `T_{2r}` at depth `r ≈ log q`). The
odd-moment vanishing is an exact structural identity provable from the Lam–Leung antipodal pairing.

## Main results

* `even_sum_of_fpf_involution` — durable combinatorial lemma: a `ℕ`-valued sum over a finset
  closed under a fixed-point-free involution `g` with `f ∘ g = f` is even.
* `neg_ne_self_of_pow_two_pow_eq_one` — for a `2^k`-th root of unity `z` in a `CharZero` field,
  `-z ≠ z`.
* `even_card_of_vanishing_dyadic_multiset` — **the T3 core**: a multiset of `2^k`-th roots of
  unity with `M.sum = 0` has `Even M.card`.
* `no_odd_length_allpositive_vanishing_sum` — the contrapositive packaging: an **odd**-cardinality
  multiset of `2^k`-th roots of unity cannot have vanishing sum.

/-- **Durable combinatorial lemma.** A `ℕ`-valued sum over a finset `s` closed under a
fixed-point-free involution `g`, with `f` invariant under `g`, is even: the finset partitions into
two-element orbits `{x, g x}`, each contributing `2 · f x`. -/

roots of unity whose sum vanishes has **even** cardinality.

The negation map `z ↦ -z` is a fixed-point-free involution on `M.toFinset` (membership balance is
`LamLeungMultisetAntipodal.count_antipodal_of_sum_eq_zero`; fixed-point-freeness is
`neg_ne_self_of_pow_two_pow_eq_one`), and `M.count` is constant on each orbit `{z, -z}` (the same
antipodal-balance identity). Hence `M.card = ∑_{z ∈ M.toFinset} M.count z` is even by
`even_sum_of_fpf_involution`. -/
