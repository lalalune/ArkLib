# Even support of the Möbius involution (#389)

The Möbius pencil involution `σ_b : Equiv.Perm G` (`x ↦ b·x⁻¹`) satisfies `σ_b² = 1`
(`mobiusInvol_sq`); hence its support (the non-fixed points) has **even** cardinality, via Mathlib's
`Equiv.Perm.two_dvd_card_support`.  The fixed points are the square roots of `b`, so this counts the
non-square-root elements in pairs — the next structural brick flagged in `MobiusPencilEnergy`.
