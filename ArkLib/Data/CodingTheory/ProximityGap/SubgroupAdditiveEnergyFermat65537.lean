# Round 12 (Issue #232, ABF26) — prize-scale additive energy on F₆₅₅₃₇, and the refutation of a
# `√q` crossover law.

This is the third (largest) prize-scale Fermat field: `F₆₅₅₃₇` (`|F^×| = 65536 = 2^16`, `65537 = 2^16+1`
the largest known Fermat prime, fully 2-power smooth, `√q ≈ 256`). Together with
`SubgroupAdditiveEnergyTowerF17` (`q=17`) and `SubgroupAdditiveEnergyFermat257` (`q=257`) it pins the
char-0 anti-concentration crossover at three scales — and **refutes** the tempting `crossover ≈ √q`
law (a 2-point over-extrapolation):

| field | `√q` | order-8 | order-16 | char-0 bound through 16? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `F₁₇`    | 4.1 | 264 (✗ already at 8) | — | no |
| `F₂₅₇`   | 16  | 168 ✓ | 912 ✗ | fails at 16 |
| `F₆₅₅₃₇` | 256 | 168 ✓ | 720 ✓ | **holds at 16** |

Crossover orders `~8, ~16, ~32` for `q = 2^4+1, 2^8+1, 2^16+1` grow far **slower** than `√q`
(`4, 16, 256`). No scaling law is asserted (three points do not determine one). What is verified:

* `energy_H8 = 168` — the **same** value as in `F₂₅₇`: the order-8 energy is `q`-independent at the
  char-0 value once `q` is large (minimal anti-concentration in the prize regime `|G| ≪ q`), and
* `energy_H16 = 720 ≤ 768 = 3|G|²` — order-16 anti-concentration **holds** here, whereas it *failed*
  at `q = 257` (`912 > 768`): for fixed `|G|` the energy decreases toward its char-0 value as `q`
  grows, so the anti-concentration regime is much larger than `√q` would suggest.

`sorry`-free, axiom-clean. The exact crossover law as `|G|, q → ∞` remains the open prize quantity.
