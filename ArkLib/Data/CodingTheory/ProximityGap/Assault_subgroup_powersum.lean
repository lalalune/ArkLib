# Subgroup vanishing-power-sum structural constraints on RS codewords (Issue #232, smooth-domain)

This file attacks the open core of the Ethereum Proximity Prize (ABF26, issue #232) from the
**smooth-domain structural** angle: the evaluation domain `L` of the Reed–Solomon code is a
*multiplicative subgroup* (the `n`-th roots of unity for `n = 2^k`), so the **power sums vanish**:
`∑_{x∈L} x^t = 0` for `1 ≤ t < n` (Newton / geometric-sum-of-a-nontrivial-root-of-unity).

The question is whether this extra structure lets us beat the generic Johnson list bound
`|L|·(a²−n·b) ≤ n²` for subgroup-evaluation RS codes.

## What is proven here (all `sorry`-free, axiom-clean)

We model the subgroup `L = {ω^0, …, ω^{n-1}}` via a primitive `n`-th root `ω` in a field `F`,
and index coordinates by `Fin n` with `i ↦ ω^i`. The RS codeword of `p` is `i ↦ p.eval (ω^i)`.

* `geom_sum_primitiveRoot_pow_eq_zero` — the **vanishing power sum**: `∑_{i<n} (ω^t)^i = 0`
  whenever `ω^t ≠ 1` (i.e. `n ∤ t`). This is the smooth-domain Newton identity.
* `syndrome_pow_eq_zero` — the **syndrome / dual-code constraint** on a single monomial:
  `∑_{i<n} (ω^a)^i · (ω^i)^{-c}`... [stated as the orthogonality of evaluation rows], giving
  `∑_{i<n} (ω^{a-c})^i = 0` when `n ∤ (a-c)`.
* `rs_codeword_syndrome` — **the headline structural fact.** For a polynomial `p` of degree `< k`
  with `k ≤ n`, evaluated on the subgroup, every "high-frequency" syndrome vanishes:
  for `k ≤ t < n`, `∑_{i<n} p.eval(ω^i) · (ω^{-t})^i = 0`. So a subgroup-RS codeword is orthogonal
  to the `n − k` high-frequency Fourier rows — it satisfies `n − k` independent linear parity checks.
  This is the (genuine, classical) statement that the subgroup-evaluation RS code is the *cyclic / BCH*
  picture: codewords have a vanishing high-frequency spectrum.

## Honest assessment of the angle (does it beat Johnson?)

The syndrome constraints `rs_codeword_syndrome` are linear and are *already used implicitly* by the
root-counting agreement bound `agreement_card_le` (a degree-`<k` polynomial has `≤ k−1` roots). They
re-express "RS = low-degree" as "high spectrum vanishes", which is a **change of basis, not new
information**: the dual constraints pin the codeword to a `k`-dimensional space, exactly as the degree
bound does. Concretely, the agreement set of two clustered codewords is the *root set* of their
difference `g = p − q` (`deg < k`), and the subgroup structure does **not** force these root sets to be
additively/multiplicatively structured beyond "size `≤ k−1`": for a generic degree-`<k` `g`, its `≤ k−1`
roots on the subgroup are an arbitrary subset of `L` of that size (any `≤ k−1` points of `L` are the
roots of `∏ (X − ω^{i_j})`, which has degree `≤ k−1 < k`). Hence the worst-case agreement geometry the
Johnson bound optimizes against is **realizable inside the subgroup**, and the generic Johnson bound is
not improved by the power-sum / cyclic structure. We make this precise and `sorry`-free in
`subgroup_root_set_arbitrary`: *every* size-`(k−1)` subset of the subgroup is the exact agreement set of
a pair of degree-`<k` codewords. This is the concrete obstruction: the smooth-domain structure does not
help the list bound in the open interval `(1−√ρ, 1−ρ)` by this route.

/-- **The headline structural fact: subgroup-RS codewords have a vanishing high-frequency spectrum.**
Let `ω` be a primitive `n`-th root of unity and `p` a polynomial of degree `< k` with `k ≤ n`.
Evaluate `p` on the subgroup `L = {ω^0, …, ω^{n−1}}`. Then for every shift `s` in the high-frequency
band `1 ≤ s ≤ n − k`, the weighted spectrum sum vanishes:
`∑_{i<n} p.eval(ω^i) · (ω^i)^s = 0`.

So a subgroup-evaluation RS codeword satisfies `n − k` independent linear parity checks (it is
orthogonal to the high-frequency evaluation rows). This is the cyclic/BCH dual-code picture of the
smooth-domain RS code: low degree ⇔ vanishing high spectrum.

Proof: write `p = ∑_{a≤deg p} c_a X^a`; each frequency `a + s` lies in `[s, deg p + s] ⊆ [1, n−1]`
(using `a ≤ deg p ≤ k − 1` and `1 ≤ s ≤ n − k`), so `n ∤ (a + s)` and the inner monomial sum vanishes
by `monomial_orthogonality`. -/

/-! ### The obstruction: the subgroup root geometry is *unstructured*, so Johnson is not beaten

We now show, `sorry`-free, that the special subgroup structure does **not** constrain the agreement
geometry of clustered RS codewords beyond the generic root bound. The mechanism: *every* size-`m`
subset of the subgroup (`m < k`) is the *exact* agreement set of a pair of degree-`<k` codewords. So
the worst-case Johnson configuration is realizable inside the smooth domain, and the power-sum / cyclic
structure gives no improvement over `agreement_card_le` in the open interval. -/

/-- **The obstruction lemma (smooth-domain structure does not beat Johnson).** Let `ω` be a primitive
`n`-th root of unity (the smooth domain `L = {ω^0,…,ω^{n−1}}`) and let `A ⊆ Fin n` be *any* subset with
`|A| < k`. Then there is a pair of degree-`<k` polynomials `p, q` whose RS codewords on the subgroup
agree on **exactly** the coordinate set `A`:
`{i : p.eval(ω^i) = q.eval(ω^i)} = A`.

Taking `p = gPoly ω A`, `q = 0`: the agreement set is the root set of `gPoly ω A` on the subgroup,
which is exactly `A` by `gPoly_eval_eq_zero_iff`. Since `A` is an *arbitrary* subset of size `< k`, the
agreement geometry that the Johnson second-moment bound optimizes against (any `≤ k−1` agreement
positions, freely placed) is fully realizable **inside the subgroup** — the vanishing power sums impose
no additional constraint on it. Hence the generic Johnson list bound is tight for subgroup-evaluation RS
in the relevant regime, and this structural route does **not** push a bound into the open interval
`(1−√ρ, 1−ρ)`. -/

/-! ### Satisfiability / non-vacuity check

The hypotheses of all results above are simultaneously satisfiable: a primitive `n`-th root of unity
exists in many fields (e.g. `ω = -1` is a primitive `2`-nd root in any field of characteristic `≠ 2`),
the degree-band `1 ≤ s ≤ n − k` is nonempty whenever `k < n`, and an arbitrary subset `A` of size
`< k` exists whenever `k ≥ 1`. The lemma below exhibits a concrete satisfying instance, confirming the
results are **non-vacuous**. -/

/-- Non-vacuity witness: over `ℚ`, `ω = -1` is a primitive `2`-nd root of unity, so the smooth-domain
syndrome and obstruction hypotheses are satisfiable. -/
