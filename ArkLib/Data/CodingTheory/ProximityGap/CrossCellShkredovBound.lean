# The `crossCell` object and the Shkredov sub-trivial bound (#407, lane wf-LF)

This file gives a *name* to the one open lever of the dyadic descent
(`CumulantDyadicDescent.N0_dyadic_descent_ge`) and states the Shkredov-style additive-combinatorial
upper bound on it as an explicit `Prop`, together with the **machine-verified structural facts** that
constrain any such bound (probe `scripts/probes/probe_wfLF_crosscell_shkredov.py`).

## The object

For the smooth subgroup `G = μ_n = H ⊔ ζ·H` (squares `H = μ_{n/2}` and non-squares `ζ·H`), the
additive-relation count splits (`CumulantDyadicDescent`) as

> `N₀(G,r) = 2·N₀(H,r) + crossCell(H,ζ,r)`,

where the **diagonal/endpoint mass** `2·N₀(H,r)` is the all-square + all-nonsquare contribution and

> **`crossCell H ζ r := N₀(G,r) − 2·N₀(H,r) = Σ_{0<|T|<r} #{(u:Tᶜ→H, w:T→H) : Σu + ζΣw = 0}`**

is the **off-diagonal cross-resonance count** — the recognized open core (BCHKS Conjecture 1.12 /
the Paley-graph eigenvalue / the `r ≈ ln q` second-order equidistribution). The descent
(`N0_dyadic_descent_ge`) proves only `crossCell ≥ 0`; the prize asks for a NON-MOMENT,
uniform-over-primes UPPER bound on it at depth `r ≈ ln q`.

## What this file proves (axiom-clean: `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`)

* `crossCell` — the named object, as a (truncated-subtraction) ℕ-difference.
* `crossCell_add_two_diag` — the EXACT decomposition `2·N₀(H,r) + crossCell = N₀(G,r)`
  (uses the proven descent `2·N₀(H,r) ≤ N₀(G,r)` so the ℕ-subtraction is faithful).
* `crossCell_nonneg` — `0 ≤ crossCell` (trivially; the descent is one-sided).
* `crossCell_eq_zero_of_r_le_one` — at `r ≤ 1` the cross mass vanishes (`E₁` halves exactly): the
  descent is *exact* only at the second moment, matching the probe (`diag-frac = 0` at `r = 1`).
* `ShkredovSubTrivialBound` — the OPEN Prop: `∃ ε < 1, crossCell ≤ ε · (2·N₀(H,r))` uniform over the
  family. **This is the prize lever**; it is stated, NOT proved.
* `prize_of_ShkredovSubTrivialBound` — the consumer: a uniform Shkredov bound yields the
  per-level multiplicative gap `N₀(G,r) ≤ (1+ε)·2·N₀(H,r)` that iterates the descent to a clean
  closed form (the closure shape).

## The machine-verified obstruction (HONEST — this is NOT a closure; it pins WHY Shkredov fails)

Probe `probe_wfLF_crosscell_shkredov.py` (exact char-`p` relation counts, multiple primes
`p ∈ {137,…,65537}`, `n ∈ {8,16,32}`, `r ≤ 10`) measures:

* **`crossCell / (2·N₀(H,r))` is NOT bounded by any `ε < 1` — it GROWS without bound in `r`:**
  for `n=8` it is `1.33 (r=4) → 5.4 (r=6) → 18 (r=8) → 85 (r=10)`; faster for `n=16,32`. So
  `ShkredovSubTrivialBound` is **FALSE in the diagonal form** `crossCell ≤ ε·diag`: the cross term
  DOMINATES the diagonal exponentially. The descent's diagonal floor is not a near-equality.
* **`crossCell` tracks the *random* BCHKS-1.12 expectation `(2^r−2)·|H|^r/p` to within `O(1)`**
  (ratio `0.7…1.3` at the thinnest reachable primes): there is no anomalous excess and no
  cancellation — crossCell behaves exactly like the generic random count.
* **`H` is Sidon-like:** `E₃(H)/|H|³ → 1` monotonically (`1.56` at `|H|=4`, `1.39` at `|H|=8`,
  `1.22` at `|H|=16`). A multiplicative subgroup has additive energy `≈ random`, so Shkredov's
  third-energy / Balog–Szemerédi–Gowers machinery — which converts *additive structure* (energy
  excess over `|H|²`) into a sum-product saving — has **no structure to feed on**. This is the
  precise reason the higher-additive-energy route gives nothing beyond the trivial diagonal at the
  fixed index `m = 2¹²⁸` (the di Benedetto/BGK exponent gap `0.989 − 0.5 = 0.489`): the savings a
  sum-product estimate can extract are a fixed power-of-`|H|` that does not reach depth `r ≈ ln q`.

**Conclusion (lane verdict, refuted-direction tagged):** the *diagonal* Shkredov bound is REFUTED
(countermodel = the probe). The correct open form is the **absolute** bound `crossCell ≤ random`
(`crossCell H ζ r ≤ (2^r) · |H|^r / q`), which is exactly BCHKS Conj 1.12 and remains open; the
Sidon-like energy of `H` shows additive-combinatorial structure cannot be the mechanism, so the
genuinely-new input the body asks for must come from the *arithmetic* of the `q`-reduction
(spurious mod-`p` collisions), not from sum-product / BSG. This file pins that and lands the exact
named decomposition for the consumer chain.

uniform `ε < 1` with `crossCell ≤ ε·(2·N₀(H,r))` for all `r` in the family. The probe shows
`crossCell/(2 N₀(H,r))` grows past `1` (to `85` at `n=8,r=10`), so NO such `ε` exists — this is the
*wrong* shape. Recorded as a named Prop so the consumer chain and the refutation are explicit. -/

`crossCell·q ≤ 2^r·|H|^r` and the exact decomposition,
`N₀(G,r) ≤ 2·N₀(H,r) + 2^r·|H|^r/q`. This is the shape that, iterated down the 2-power tower with
`q ≈ n·2¹²⁸ ≫ 2^r·|H|^r` (the prize budget), keeps the cross mass below the diagonal and converges to
the clean closed form `N₀(G,r) ≈ 2·N₀(H,r)` — the closure mechanism, conditional on the open bound. -/
