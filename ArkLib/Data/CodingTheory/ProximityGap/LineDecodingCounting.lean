# Refutation of the double-coverage counting reduction (GG25 / ABF26 Thm 4.21 wall)

`ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/LineDecoding.lean` reduces the residual `sorry` of
`lineDecodable_imp_epsMCA_le` to a **pure-`Nat` double-coverage count**: an aligned-and-
`mcaEvent` index finset `H` with `|H| ≥ n+1`, a per-index witness set `S γ` each missing at
most `m := ⌊δ·n⌋` positions of a fixed target set `T := S_{γ₀}`, should force *every* position
of `T` to be covered by `≥ 2` indices of `H` (two distinct zeros of the affine
`g_i(γ) = (u₁-f₁) i + γ·(u₂-f₂) i` pin `u₁ i = f₁ i`, `u₂ i = f₂ i`, giving
`pairJointAgreesOn` on all of `T`).

`pairJointAgreesOn` is **antitone** in its set argument, so the contradiction genuinely needs
double coverage of the *full* `T`, not merely most of it.

This file proves that reduction target is **false** for every `m ≥ 1` (equivalently `δ ≥ 1/n`,
the only non-degenerate proximity regime): a single shared missed position defeats it for an
arbitrarily large `H`. Hence the residual `sorry` is a precisely-characterized wall, not a
missing leaf proof; the faithful route requires exposing the Guruswami–Sudan interpolation
degree in the statement of `LineDecodable` (a documented statement repair), per the in-file
analysis in `LineDecoding.lean`.

This is a refutation artifact, not a closure of the target theorem.

/-- **The double-coverage counting reduction of GG25 / ABF26 Thm 4.21 is false for `m ≥ 1`.**

There exist a finite index type `Φ` (the field-element / `γ` index), a finite domain `ι`, an
index finset `H ⊆ Φ`, per-index witness sets `S : Φ → Finset ι`, a target set `T ⊆ ι`, a
position `i₀ ∈ T`, and a miss budget `m ≥ 1`, such that:

* every `γ ∈ H` misses at most `m` positions of `T` (`((univ \ S γ) ∩ T).card ≤ m`);
* the index budget is met, `n + 1 ≤ |H|` (here even with room to spare, `|H| = 5 ≥ 3`);
* `i₀ ∈ T`;

yet `i₀` is **not** double-covered: `|{γ ∈ H : i₀ ∈ S γ}| < 2`.

Witnesses: `Φ = Fin 5`, `ι = Fin 3` (so `n = 3` here — the bound `n+1 ≤ |H|` is `4 ≤ 5`),
`T = {0,1,2} = univ`, `m = 1`, and `S γ = {1,2}` for every `γ` — every index misses exactly the
single position `0 = i₀`. The shared miss makes `i₀` covered `0 < 2` times while `|H|` is free.
The affine `g_{i₀}` then receives only one linear equation, so `(u₁,u₂)` is unpinned at `i₀`
and `pairJointAgreesOn` on the full `T` cannot be derived. -/
