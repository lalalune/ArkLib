# CS25 count-budget arithmetic (toward T4.17, #82)

The CS25 breakdown count budget (`sum_far_plus_jointProx_lt_of_close_ge`) needs the strict
inequality `q^{n+1}·#{far} + #{jointProx} < #stacks` with `#stacks = q^{2n}` (the `Fin 2` stacks over
a size-`q` field). This file supplies the pure-arithmetic closer: it holds as soon as the two
entropy bounds give `#{far} ≤ q^{n−2}` (coverage) and `#{jointProx} ≤ q^{2n−2}` (the jointProx
sub-band bound), for any `q ≥ 2`:

  `q^{n+1}·q^{n−2} + q^{2n−2} = q^{2n−1} + q^{2n−2} = q^{2n−2}·(q+1) < q^{2n−2}·q² = q^{2n}`  (`q+1 < q²`).

/-- **CS25 count-budget closer.** If `#{far} ≤ q^{n−2}` and `#{jointProx} ≤ q^{2n−2}` with `q ≥ 2`
and `n ≥ 2`, the breakdown count budget `q^{n+1}·#{far} + #{jointProx} < q^{2n}` holds. -/
