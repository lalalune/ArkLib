# The top-cancellation law (#371, rung): high-degree direction rows

For rows whose direction interpolant outdegrees the witness budget, the
identity's top coefficient pins the scalar: `coeff_d(R₀) + γ·lead(R₁) = 0` at
`d = deg R₁` since every other term lives below.  At most ONE bad scalar —
the general-stack stratum of `SubCeilingInteriorCeiling` with
`deg R₁ > deg g + |S|` is closed by `top_cancellation_unique`.
