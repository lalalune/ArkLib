# MCA-side lower-bound bridge: bad-scalar spread on a pencil

Background.  List-size lower bounds for Reed-Solomon proximity gaps do NOT transfer to
the MCA error automatically (in-tree no-go: a large list at one word does not force a
large MCA error).  An MCA lower bound must instead exhibit *bad-scalar spread*: a single
pencil `γ ↦ f₁ + γ·f₂` for which many scalars `γ` give words close to the code, while
the pair `(f₁, f₂)` admits no correlated agreement — no single coordinate set of size
`≥ a` on which both endpoints simultaneously match codewords.

Contents (everything below is fully proved, no placeholders):

1. `mcaBadCount_ge_of_spread` — the definition-level bridge: if every `γ` in a scalar
   set `Γ` gives a close pencil word, and no single agreement set of size `≥ a` serves
   all `γ ∈ Γ` simultaneously (witness inconsistency), then the MCA bad-scalar count of
   the pencil is at least `Γ.card`.  Key point: for a code closed under the pencil
   operation, a correlated-agreement set would serve *every* scalar at once with the
   consistent witness `u + γ·v`, so witness inconsistency refutes correlated agreement,
   and then every close scalar is MCA-bad.
2. `mcaBadFraction_ge_of_spread` — the same bound in fraction (error-probability) form.
3. `closeAt_pencil_of_corrAgree` — the converse sanity direction: correlated agreement
   forces every pencil word to be close with the consistent witness on the same set.
   This is exactly the structure a lower-bound construction must break.
4. A concrete kernel-checked instance over `ZMod 5`: domain of 3 points, code = the
   constant words (Reed-Solomon with `k = 1`), agreement threshold `a = 2 = k + t`,
   explicit `f₁ = ![0,1,2]`, `f₂ = ![0,1,4]`.  Exactly THREE bad scalars `{2, 3, 4}`
   out of five, each with its own explicit codeword witness, the witnesses pairwise
   inconsistent; the pair has no correlated agreement; bad fraction `3/5`.

Honest scope.  The bridge reduces an MCA-error lower bound exactly to constructing
`(f₁, f₂, Γ)` with `|Γ| / |F|` large and no shared agreement set.  The instance here
realizes the full pipeline at toy scale (`n = 3`, `|F| = 5`, spread fraction `3/5`).
What remains open — and is NOT claimed here — is the prize-scale version: smooth-domain
RS with `|F| < 2^256`, `δ*` strictly between `1 - √ρ` and `1 - ρ`, and a pencil whose
bad-scalar fraction exceeds `2^{-128}`.  No statement below asserts anything about that
regime; the general super-polynomial bad-scalar construction is out of reach of this
file and is recorded as the open gap.

/-- **Bad-scalar spread bridge** (the definition-level combinatorial core).

If every scalar `γ` in the set `Γ` makes the pencil word `f1 + γ·f2` close to the code,
and the closeness witnesses are inconsistent — no single agreement set `S` of size `≥ a`
carries a codeword for ALL `γ ∈ Γ` simultaneously — then the MCA bad-scalar count of the
pencil is at least `Γ.card`.

Proof shape: correlated agreement of `(f1, f2)` would hand every scalar the consistent
witness `u + γ·v` on one shared set (code closure), contradicting the inconsistency
hypothesis; so correlated agreement fails, and then each close scalar is MCA-bad. -/

/-! ## Concrete instance over `ZMod 5`

Domain: 3 points (`Fin 3`).  Code: the five constant words — Reed-Solomon with `k = 1`
on a 3-point domain.  Agreement threshold `a = 2 = k + t` with `t = 1`.

`f₁ = (0, 1, 2)` and `f₂ = (0, 1, 4)`; the pencil word at `γ` is `(0, 1 + γ, 2 + 4γ)`.
Coordinate collisions happen at `γ = 4` (coords 0,1), `γ = 2` (coords 0,2), and `γ = 3`
(coords 1,2), so exactly the three scalars `{2, 3, 4}` give close words, each witnessed
by a different constant on a different 2-point set, while `f₁` itself is injective, so
the pair has no correlated agreement at threshold 2. -/
