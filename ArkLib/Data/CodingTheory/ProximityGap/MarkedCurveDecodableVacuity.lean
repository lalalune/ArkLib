# Non-vacuity fence for marked curve decodability (#389, B2 lane)

The marked-variant sanity fence paralleling `curveDecodable_of_card_lt`: when the marked-set size
`a` exceeds the field size `|F|`, the hypothesis `A₀.card = a` is unsatisfiable (a `Finset F` has at
most `|F|` elements), so `MarkedCurveDecodable C ℓ δ a b` holds vacuously.  The meaningful regimes are
exactly `a ≤ |F|`.  Completes the structural grid of the marked variant alongside
`markedCurveDecodable_mono_marked_set_size`.

/-- **Non-vacuity of the marked shape** (sanity fence): with the marked-set size above the field
size the hypothesis `A₀.card = a` is unsatisfiable, so every code is trivially
`(ℓ, δ, a, b)`-marked-curve-decodable — the meaningful regimes are exactly `a ≤ |F|`. -/
