# The aggregate cross-parity (butterfly cross-term) identity (#407, lane F / Pan–Xu split)

## What this file proves

The dyadic FFT butterfly splits a level-`(i+1)` subgroup Gauss sum into its two level-`i`
children: with `H = G ∪ ζ•G` (disjoint),
`η_b(H) = η_b(G) + η_{ζb}(G)` (`eta_union_dilate`). Squaring,
`‖η_b(H)‖² = ‖η_b(G)‖² + ‖η_{ζb}(G)‖² + X(b)`,
where the **cross-parity term**
`X(b) := ‖η_b(H)‖² − ‖η_b(G)‖² − ‖η_{ζb}(G)‖² = 2·Re(η_b(G)·conj η_{ζb}(G))`
is the alignment excess — the *cross-parity* contribution to the far-line incidence whose
worst case is the open BGK sup-norm wall (`SubgroupGaussSumDilationRecursion`: the `√2`-vs-`2`
gap is the open core).

This file isolates the **first moment** of the cross-parity term — the part that is *clean,
exact, and `q`-independent*, in contrast to the worst case (`L^∞`) and the energy (`L²`), both
of which are the open BGK object. The two headline identities:

* `crossTerm_sum_zero` — **the full aggregate vanishes**:  `∑_{b∈F} X(b) = 0`.
  Pure Parseval: `∑_b ‖η_b(H)‖² = q·|H| = q·2|G| = ∑_b ‖η_b(G)‖² + ∑_b ‖η_{ζb}(G)‖²`, the dilate
  reindex `b ↦ ζb` (a bijection of `F`) making the third sum equal to the second.
* `crossTerm_sum_nonzero_eq` — **the off-zero aggregate is exactly `−2|G|²`**:
  `∑_{b≠0} X(b) = −2·|G|²`, because the only frequency carrying positive cross-parity *in
  aggregate* is `b = 0` (`X(0) = |H|² − 2|G|² = (2|G|)² − 2|G|² = 2|G|²`).

## The honest localization (the laneF result, three outcomes)

* **LANDED clean cross-parity identity** (this file): the *first moment* of the cross-parity term
  is exactly `−2|G|²`, `q`-independent — and **negative**. So *on aggregate the cross-parity term
  SUPPRESSES, it does not amplify*: the butterfly children are anti-aligned on average across
  frequencies. This is the exact, provable cross-parity bound the lane sought.
* **REFUTED localization hope** (`docs`/probe, see DISPROOF_LOG): the conjecture that the
  *positive* (amplifying) cross-parity is confined to `O(log n)` imprimitive frequencies is FALSE
  in the frequency picture — numerically the positive part `∑_{X(b)>0} X(b)` spreads over `Θ(q)`
  frequencies (`probe_crossparity_localize.py`). The aggregate is held negative by an even larger
  negative mass, not by sparsity of the positive part.
* **PRECISE reduction to the named core**: the *worst single-frequency* cross term
  `max_b X(b)` and the *energy* `∑_b X(b)²` are NOT `q`-independent (the latter grows like
  `q·E₂(G)`); these are exactly the BGK / additive-energy sup-norm wall already named in
  `SubgroupGaussSumDilationRecursion` and `_DyadicDeviationDecayEnvelope`. The first moment being
  clean while the L²/L^∞ are open is the precise statement of *which* part of the cross-parity is
  elementary and which is the open core.

Everything here is `sorry`/`axiom`-free and axiom-clean (`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`).

## Non-vacuity: the dyadic 2-power subgroup tower realizes the hypotheses

The hypotheses `ζ ≠ 0` and `Disjoint G (dilate ζ G)` are **genuinely satisfiable** in the prize
regime, not vacuous: take `G = μ_k` (the `k`-th roots of unity) and `ζ` a primitive `2k`-th root
(`ζ^k = -1`). Then `dilate ζ μ_k = ζ·μ_k = μ_k^{(-1)}` (the "negative half", `{x : x^k = -1}`),
which is disjoint from `μ_k` in odd characteristic (`(1:F) ≠ -1`), and `μ_k ∪ ζ·μ_k = μ_{2k}`.
This is exactly the `eta_halving` split. Hence the clean cross-parity identity applies to the
actual dyadic Gaussian-period tower. -/

/-- **The dyadic split realizes the dilate-union hypotheses.** For `ζ^k = -1` in odd characteristic,
`μ_k` and its `ζ`-dilate are disjoint and their union is `μ_{2k}`. This certifies that
`crossTerm_sum_nonzero_eq` is non-vacuous for the prize-regime dyadic subgroup. -/

/-- **The clean cross-parity identity, realized on the dyadic subgroup tower (non-vacuous form).**
For the actual dyadic Gaussian period over `μ_{2k} = μ_k ⊔ ζ·μ_k` (`ζ^k = -1`, odd char), the
first moment of the butterfly cross-parity term over the nonzero frequencies is exactly
`−2·|μ_k|²`. This instantiates `crossTerm_sum_nonzero_eq` with the prize-regime dyadic split
certified by `dyadic_dilate_split`, so the identity is not vacuously true. -/
