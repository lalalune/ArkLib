# I031: the union-bound hypothesis is EQUIVALENT to the pointwise period bound (#444, #407)

The I031 capstone (`I031LogTargetForm.i031_M_le_logTarget`) lands the prize-target sup-norm bound
`M(μ_n) ≤ √(2·(C₀·n)·log(q/n))` *conditional* on the single named-open analytic input
`SubGaussianTailBound (periodMagnitudes ψ G) (C₀·n) m` (`I031SubGaussianMaxBridge`). Separately,
the #407 file `ConstantIndexSubGaussianPeriod` isolates the SAME wall as a **pointwise** per-period
Prop `ConstantIndexSubGaussianPeriodBound : ∀ b ≠ 0, ‖η_b‖ ≤ √(2·n·log m)`. Until now these two
"named open" objects were **never connected** — a `SubGaussianTailBound` was *consumed* by I031 but
*never constructed* anywhere in the tree, and the #407 pointwise conjecture never reached the I031
consumer.

This file closes that gap with an **exact equivalence**, after a careful probe correction.

## The probe-corrected relationship (rule 2, rule 4)

`probe_subgaussian_tail_from_pointwise.py` (EXACT `F_p`, PROPER thin `μ_n`, `n=2^a`, `p ≡ 1 (n)`,
`(p−1)/n ≥ 2`, NEVER `n=q−1`, primes incl. `p > n³` and Fermat 257) shows the **full** tail Prop
`∀ s > 0, #{v > s} ≤ m·exp(−s²/2C)` (with proxy `C = n`) is *strictly stronger* than the pointwise
bound: it is **VIOLATED at small `s`** (e.g. `p=97, n=8`: `#{v>s} − m·exp(−s²/2n) = 0.45` at
`s≈0.78`), because near `s=0` almost all `m` distinct magnitudes exceed `s` while `m·exp(−s²/2n)<m`.

BUT `probe_tail_above_threshold.py` (same EXACT setup, extended to `p=40961`) shows the tail Prop
**restricted to `s ≥ s* := √(2C·log m)`** is TRUE in `13/13` configs, and is *equivalent* to the
pointwise bound `M ≤ s*`. The key structural fact that makes this matter: the consumer
`subgaussian_max_le` only ever invokes its tail hypothesis at thresholds `s ∈ (s*, v)`, i.e. at
`s > s*`. So the I031 union bound never *needs* the gratuitously-strong full-`s` Prop — it needs
only the `s ≥ s*` restriction, which is exactly the #407 pointwise bound.

## What this file proves (axiom-clean; CORE stays OPEN)

* `SubGaussianTailBoundAbove S C m`: the tail-count Prop restricted to `s ≥ s*` (the genuinely
  needed hypothesis).
* `subGaussianTailBoundAbove_iff_forall_le`: it is **logically equivalent** to the pointwise max
  bound `∀ v ∈ S, v ≤ s*` (the headline — the two named-open objects are ONE).
* `subgaussian_max_le_above`: the weakened Prop still drives the I031 max bound (the consumer only
  needed `s ≥ s*`).
* `pointwise_le_of_subGaussianTailBound`: the FULL tail Prop implies the pointwise bound (so the
  full Prop ⟹ the above-threshold Prop, consistent with "strictly stronger").

This **wires the #407 pointwise conjecture to the I031 capstone** for the first time: the I031
hypothesis can be replaced by the genuinely-equivalent pointwise period bound. It does NOT close
CORE (`M(μ_n) ≤ C·√(n·log(p/n))`) — the pointwise bound is itself the BGK/Lamzouri wall. It removes
a *spurious over-strength* in the I031 interface and exhibits the exact equivalence the dossier
asserts informally.

NON-MOMENT (pure threshold/extreme-value real analysis on a finset of magnitudes), EXTEND-proven
(sits directly on `I031SubGaussianMaxBridge.subgaussian_max_le` + its `s*` scale). ONE sweep, ONE
commit. Axiom-clean (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`); no `sorry`.

/-- **The above-threshold sub-Gaussian tail bound** — the tail-count Prop restricted to the
thresholds the union bound actually uses, `s ≥ s* := √(2·C·log m)`. Probe-shown (rule 2) to be the
genuinely-needed hypothesis: the full-`s` `SubGaussianTailBound` is strictly stronger (violated at
small `s`), but `subgaussian_max_le` only invokes the tail at `s > s*`. -/
def SubGaussianTailBoundAbove (S : Finset ℝ) (C m : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ s : ℝ, Real.sqrt (2 * C * Real.log m) ≤ s →
    ((S.filter (fun v => s < v)).card : ℝ) ≤ m * Real.exp (-(s ^ 2) / (2 * C))

/-- **The headline equivalence.** For `0 < C`, `1 ≤ m`, the above-threshold tail Prop is logically
equivalent to the *pointwise* max bound `∀ v ∈ S, v ≤ √(2·C·log m)`. So the I031 named-open
`SubGaussianTailBoundAbove` and the #407 pointwise period conjecture are literally the SAME object.

*Proof.* (⟸) If every `v ≤ s*` then for any `s ≥ s*` the filter `{v ∈ S : s < v}` is EMPTY (no `v`
exceeds `s ≥ s* ≥ v`), so its card is `0 ≤ m·exp(…)` (the RHS is `≥ 0`). (⟹) Given the tail at the
single threshold `s = s*`: `#{v > s*} ≤ m·exp(−(s*)²/2C) = m·exp(−log m) = 1`. We show `#{v > s*}`
is in fact `0`: if some `v > s*` then `#{v > s*} ≥ 1`; but pushing to a strictly larger `s ∈ (s*, v)`
makes the RHS `< 1` while `v` is still counted — contradiction (this is exactly the
`subgaussian_max_le` mechanism). Hence no `v` exceeds `s*`. -/
