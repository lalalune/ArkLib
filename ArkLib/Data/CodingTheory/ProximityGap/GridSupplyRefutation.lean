# The sheared-grid word: the FIXED-BAND word-capped supply floor (#389)

Companion to the #389 countermodel convergence (`SubplaneSupplyFloor.lean`,
`FrobeniusSubfieldBlowup.lean`, `AffinePlaneSharpness.lean`).  Those witnesses live at
the Johnson-scale band (their cap `2k+m+1 = r` grows like `√n`) or need subfield
structure; this file contributes the two cells they leave open:

1. **The fixed-band word-capped floor.**  The `6×6` sheared-grid word
   (`(i,j) ↦ (i+7j, j)`, abscissae = base-7 digits, so the grid is a word graph and
   shears preserve lines) at `(k, m) = (2, 1)`, `t = 4`, `cap = 6`, `n = 36` lies in
   the exact hypothesis class of `SubJohnsonSupplyResidual gridDom 2 1` — *no* affine
   codeword agrees with it on more than `6` points, proved structurally
   (`grid_word_cap`: a non-constant line meets each constant row at most once; a
   constant one lives in one row).  Yet `subJohnsonSupplyResidual_floor_grid`:
   every valid `B` satisfies `234 ≤ B` — strictly above the partition target
   `⌊n/cap⌋·C(cap,t) = 90` and the mean-degree-law target `(2n/cap)·C(cap,t) = 180`
   (inside the proven unconditional pair-count `C(36,2) = 630`).  The mean-degree
   form `grid_mean_degree_violation`: `22` codewords with agreement `≥ 4` and mass
   `> 2n`, all inside the cap.  So the announced `Σ_c a_c ≤ 2n` law is false *on the
   residual's own hypothesis class*, already at one fixed band.

2. **The prime-field additive mechanism.**  The grid is a rank-2 generalized
   arithmetic progression: the construction transfers verbatim (ℤ-collinearity) to
   `F_p` for EVERY prime `p > 2N³` — including subfield-free production primes
   (M31/BabyBear/Goldilocks) where the subplane and Frobenius mechanisms vanish.
   Asymptotically (family-capped, `N ≥ cap`) it is the Szemerédi–Trotter extremal:
   `Θ(n²/t³)` `t`-rich lines, mass `Θ(n²/t²)`, violation `×11.2` at `n = 400`
   (`scripts/probes/probe_grid_supply_refutation.py`).  Hence "prime `q`" alone
   cannot rescue a linear supply law — the positive side must couple to the
   *domain* (`μ_n` additive unstructure), and the corrected shape target for
   additive domains is the small-set finite-field ST curve `L_t = O(n²/t³ + n/t)`
   (Stevens–de Zeeuw gives the unconditional partial `O(n^{11/4}/t^{15/4})`,
   beating packing for `t > n^{3/7}`).
