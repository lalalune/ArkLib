  Ethereum Proximity Prize (ABF26 / ArkLib #232) — Round 10, ANGLE 2.

  Lam–Leung JOINT t = 2 tightness: the exact (e₁, e₂) = (0,0) fiber.

  SETTING.  A smooth 2-power evaluation domain is a cyclic group
  G = ⟨ζ⟩ of order 2N with ζ^(2N) = 1.  Because the order is even,
  ζ^N = -1, so the domain splits into antipodal pairs {ζ^j, ζ^(j+N)}
  with ζ^(j+N) = -ζ^j.  Squaring sends G onto the order-N subgroup
  G₂ = ⟨ζ²⟩ (still a 2-power group; -1 ∈ G₂ once N is even, i.e. m ≥ 2).

  We model a subset S ⊆ G by its **signed multiplicity** function
      a : Fin (2N) → K ,
  where `K` is the COEFFICIENT field (think ℚ; for a genuine subset
  a j ∈ {0,1}) and `a j` is the multiplicity of the root ζ^j.  The roots
  themselves live in a (possibly larger) `K`-algebra `L` — the cyclotomic
  field K(ζ_{2N}) — via the embedding `ω : Fin (2N) → L`.  The two-type
  separation (coefficients in K, roots in L) is what makes the
  cyclotomic-independence hypothesis GENUINELY SATISFIABLE for all N
  (see the honesty discussion at the very bottom): over K = ℚ the first
  N roots ζ⁰,…,ζ^{N-1} are a power basis of ℚ(ζ_{2N}) [degree φ(2N)=N],
  hence ℚ-linearly independent.  (A one-type "indep over L" version would
  be VACUOUS for N ≥ 2 because L is 1-dimensional over itself.)

  POWER-SUM CONDITIONS  (sums taken in L, with the K-action a j • ω j):
    t = 1 :  ∑ⱼ a j • ω j   = 0   (∑_{x∈S} x  = 0).
    t = 2 :  ∑ⱼ a j • (ω j)² = 0  (∑_{x∈S} x² = 0).

  CYCLOTOMIC-INDEPENDENCE inputs (true over K = ℚ ⊂ ℂ; FALSE over small
  finite fields), taken as explicit `K`-linear-independence hypotheses:
    (H1) {ω j : j < N}      is K-linearly independent in L   (level G).
    (H2) the analogous fact one level down in G₂ = ⟨ζ²⟩       (level G₂).

  RESULT.  Under (H1), t = 1 forces S antipodal:  a(j+N) = a j
  (S = -S = P ⊔ -P).  Under (H2), the t = 2 condition descends to a
  vanishing t = 1 power-sum over the SQUARES in G₂, whose antipodal
  structure pins the fiber down to the order-4 ⟨ω⟩-symmetric subsets — the
  EXACT (e₁,e₂) = 0 fiber, matching the Round-8 lower bound C(n/4, s) as an
  EQUALITY.  We reduce both levels to one clean structural lemma applied
  TWICE.  Non-vacuity is witnessed by S = ∅ and by a genuine ω-orbit.

/-! ## Two-level descent: the JOINT (e₁,e₂)=0 fiber. -/

/- The squared-root family `j ↦ (ω j)²` lands in the order-`N` subgroup
   G₂ = ⟨ζ²⟩.  We package the level-down root system `R₂` whose roots are the
   squares.  The MATH: given S antipodal (`a hi = a lo`), the t = 2 sum is
       ∑_j a j (ω j)²  =  ∑_{j<N} (a lo + a hi)(ω lo)²  = 2 ∑_{j<N} a lo·(ω lo)²
   (pairs add; squares of antipodes coincide).  So the t = 2 condition is a
   vanishing t = 1 power-sum over the SQUARES, to which
   `antipodal_of_powerSum_zero` applies one level down. -/

    each square `(ω lo j)²` sits among the level-down roots, the bridge

    `b = 2 · a lo` pushed along `emb` (0 elsewhere).

  HONESTY / SCOPE NOTE.
  • What IS proved (axiom-clean, no sorry): the EXACT structural
    characterization of the joint (e₁,e₂)=(0,0) Lam–Leung fiber as a two-level
    antipodal descent — t=1 ⟹ S = -S (antipodal), and then t=2 ⟹ the squares
    are antipodal one level down in G₂ — under explicit K-linear cyclotomic-
    independence hypotheses at BOTH levels.  This is the fiber whose count is
    the order-4 ⟨ω⟩-symmetric subsets, matching the Round-8 lower bound
    C(n/4, s) as an equality.
  • The independence hypotheses are taken as inputs.  They are GENUINELY
    SATISFIABLE (NON-vacuous): over the coefficient field K = ℚ, the first N
    roots ζ⁰,…,ζ^{N-1} form a power basis of the cyclotomic field ℚ(ζ_{2N})
    (degree φ(2N) = N for 2N a 2-power), hence are ℚ-linearly independent —
    for EVERY N, not merely N=1.  (The two-type K/L design is exactly what
    avoids the vacuity of a one-type "indep over L" version, since L is
    1-dimensional over itself.)  A concrete literal inhabitant for N=1 over
    K=L=ℚ is exhibited (`oneRootSystem`, `genuine_orbit_t1`).
  • The independence hypotheses FAIL over small finite fields (where extra
    cyclotomic relations exist); this is the honest q-dependence — the
    characterization is the EXACT fiber over ℂ/ℚ, and only a bound elsewhere.
  • NOT proved here: the cardinality count C(n/4, s) itself, nor the global
    list-size two-sided bracket; this file isolates and proves the structural
    fiber-characterization keystone (ANGLE 2).
