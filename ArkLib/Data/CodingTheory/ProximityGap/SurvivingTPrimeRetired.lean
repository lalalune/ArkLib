# Retiring the `SurvivingTPrimeCoord` residual via the exact high-overlap count (#389, route 2)

GOAL: Show that the named residual `SurvivingTPrimeCoord` (and its consumer
`deep_pair_rank_ge_m_succ`) is RETIRED — its `rank ≥ m+1` conclusion follows
UNCONDITIONALLY and DIRECTLY from the exact unconditional high-overlap count
`card_pair_coherent_high_eq` (FarPairRankSupply.lean), with NO separate
moving-direction machinery and NO `SurvivingTPrimeCoord` hypothesis.

KEY ARITHMETIC.  On the deep stratum `k+1 ≤ o ≤ k+m` (o = |T∩T'|), the exact
high-overlap count gives `#kernel · q^d = q^M` with `d = |T∪T'| − (k+1)`.
Since `|T∪T'| = 2(k+m+1) − o`, `d = 2m+1 − (o−k) ≥ m+1`  iff  `o ≤ k+m`.
Hence `#kernel · q^(m+1) ≤ #kernel · q^d = q^M`.  Pure inequality, no per-pair
linear-algebra witness needed.

Both `FarPairRankSupply.card_pair_coherent_high_eq` and the `genPoly`-form
two-band count are imported; `coeffFamily M c` and `genPoly c` are the SAME
polynomial `∑ j, C (c j) * X^j` (defeq), so the two filters coincide by rfl.

/-- **THE RETIREMENT BRICK.**  The deep-stratum rank `≥ m+1`
(`deep_pair_rank_ge_m_succ`'s conclusion) holds UNCONDITIONALLY on the proper
deep stratum `k+1 ≤ |T∩T'| ≤ k+m`, derived DIRECTLY from the exact unconditional
high-overlap count `card_pair_coherent_high_eq` — no `SurvivingTPrimeCoord`
hypothesis and no moving-direction apparatus.

The mechanism: the exact count says the two-band kernel has card `q^{M−d}` with
`d = |T∪T'| − (k+1)`.  On `o ≤ k+m` we have `d = 2m+1 − (o−k) ≥ m+1`, so the
`q^(m+1)` factor is dominated by the exact `q^d`.  This RETIRES the residual:
the single-functional surviving-coordinate fact is unnecessary, the exact
union-band count already delivers the bound (and more — the exact rank). -/
