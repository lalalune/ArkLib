# Issue #232: the per-line pair co-occurrence bound (round 14)

The per-line refinement of the second-moment kernel (rounds 13/13b). The global second moment
`∑_w |Λ(w,r)|² = |C|·∑ A_w·I(w,r)` averages over ALL centers in `Fⁿ` and provably cannot pin the
interior threshold (Markov over `q^n` centers is hopeless). The proximity-gap quantity lives on
*lines* `{f + γ·g : γ ∈ F}` — so the kernel must be restricted to a line. This file proves the
elementary core of that restriction:

**Pair co-occurrence bound.** On a line with nowhere-zero direction (`g i ≠ 0` for all `i`),
for ANY two words `c ≠ c'` at Hamming distance `w` and agreement threshold `a`, the number `B` of
line points having agreement `≥ a` with BOTH `c` and `c'` satisfies
    `B · 2a  ≤  B · w + 2(n − w)`,
i.e. `B ≤ 2(n−w)/(2a−w)` whenever `2a > w`, and `B = 0` whenever `2a > 2n − w`.

**Proof shape (one-vote double counting).** Since `g i ≠ 0`, coordinate `i` agrees with `c` at
exactly one `γ` (the vote `γᵢ(c) = (cᵢ − fᵢ)/gᵢ`). Off the support of `c − c'` the votes for `c`
and `c'` coincide (shared votes, at most `n − w` across the whole line, *pairwise disjoint in γ*);
on the support they are disjoint at every fixed `γ`. A doubly-good `γ` with shared-vote count `t`
and disjoint counts `u, u'` has `a ≤ t + u`, `a ≤ t + u'`, `u + u' ≤ w`, hence `2t ≥ 2a − w`;
summing the disjoint `t`'s over the bad set gives the bound.

This is the same one-vote-per-coordinate primitive as `Hab25Core` (Lemma 1 of ePrint 2025/2110,
[AHIV17/BKS18]) but combined differently: Hab25 bounds the folds matching a *fixed* codeword pair
across the interleaved disagreement set; here we bound the *co-occurrence of two codewords* in the
per-point agreement lists along the line — the off-diagonal term of the per-line second moment.

**Sharpness / non-vacuity (numeric witness).** On `RS[8,4]` over `F₁₇` with the smooth order-8
evaluation domain `⟨2⟩ = {1,2,4,8,9,13,15,16}` (rate `1/2`, `d = 5`) at the strict-interior
agreement threshold `a = 5` (`δ = 3/8 ∈ (1−√½, ½)`), every pair has `w ∈ [5,8]` and `2a = 10 > w`,
so the bound binds on EVERY pair: co-occurrence `≤ 1` for `w ∈ {5,6}` and `= 0` for `w ∈ {7,8}`.
An exhaustive scan of 80 lines (random, codeword-direction, near-codeword base; 4181 co-occurring
pairs) matched exactly: every `w ∈ {5,6}` pair co-occurred exactly once, no `w ∈ {7,8}` pair ever
co-occurred, zero violations. In the prize window (`ρ = 1/2`, `δ ∈ (1−√ρ, 1−ρ)`) every codeword
pair satisfies `2a > w`, so the bound is never vacuous there.
