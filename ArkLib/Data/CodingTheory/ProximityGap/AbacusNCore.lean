# The abacus `n`-core and its emptiness criterion (#389)

This is the combinatorial companion to `RootsOfUnityVandermonde`. The β-numbers of a partition
`λ` (padded to `n` parts), `β_j = λ_j + (n-1-j)`, are `n` distinct naturals. James–Kerber's
*abacus* places one bead at each `β_j` on `n` vertical runners indexed by `β_j mod n`; sliding
every bead down its runner ("gravity") yields the β-set of the **`n`-core** of `λ`.

We formalize the abacus directly and prove the criterion used in the prize obstruction:

> **`nCoreEmpty_iff_injOn_mod`** — the abacus `n`-core is *empty* (gravity returns the trivial
> β-set `{0,1,…,n-1}`) **iff** the bead residues `β_j mod n` are pairwise distinct, i.e. the
> beads occupy every runner exactly once.

Combined with `genVandermonde_rootsOfUnity_det_ne_zero_iff`, this gives the exact statement: at a
smooth domain `μ_n`, the higher-order-MDS determinant for `λ` vanishes **iff** the `n`-core of
`λ` is nonempty. (That the abacus core agrees with rim-hook removal is the classical
James–Kerber theorem, cited; here `nCoreEmpty` is taken as the abacus definition.)

Axiom-clean; finite combinatorics over `Fin n`.
