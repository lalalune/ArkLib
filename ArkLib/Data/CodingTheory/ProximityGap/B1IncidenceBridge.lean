# Wiring B1's unconditional count law toward the exact `δ*` (far-line incidence) object (#407)

## The two objects, kept STRICTLY separate (anti-conflation)

The landed B1 count law
(`SubsetSurj.topReadouts_card_eq_n_unconditional`) proves, axiom-clean and `p`-independent,
that the number of **distinct top-direction divided-difference readout VALUES** over the
`(k+1)`-subsets of `μ_n = nthRootsFinset n 1` is **exactly `n`**:

  `#{ dividedDifferencePow R v (n-1) : R ∈ powersetCard (k+1) } = n`.

The exact `δ*` object (`FarCosetExplosion.epsMCA_ge_far_incidence`) is a *different* count —
the **worst-case far-line incidence**: for a far direction `u₁` and offset `u₀`,

  `I = #{ γ : F | the line u₀ + γ·u₁ agrees with some codeword on a witness-sized set }`,

and `δ*` is pinned from above by the *maximum* of `I` over far stacks (the "binder").

These are **NOT the same quantity, and this file refuses to conflate them.**  The trap (the
prior circular B2 attempt) is to identify the *value-fiber* of the readout map — the number of
`(k+1)`-subsets sharing one readout value, `≈ C(n,k+1)/n` — with the incidence `I`.  Exhaustive
enumeration (`probe_farline_incidence_exact`, p-independent) separates all THREE:

| `n,k` | distinct readout VALUES (`= n`, PROVEN) | max value-FIBER (`≈ C(n,k+1)/n`, GROWS) | worst-case far INCIDENCE (the δ* binder, OPEN) |
|-------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 8,2   | 8                                       | 7                                        | 9   (at `r=4`, binder `(a,b)=(5,2)`)            |
| 12,3  | 12                                      | 43                                       | 13  (at `r=6`, binder `(6,4)`)                  |
| 16,4  | 16                                      | 273                                      | 89  (at `r=10`, binder `(10,4)`)                |

The value-fiber numbers `7, 43, 273` are the ones the prior attempt mistook for incidence; the
*actual* incidence binders `9, 13, 89` occur at a DIFFERENT agreement-set size `r` (past Johnson)
and a DIFFERENT direction (`b = k`, not the top `b = n-1`).  So:

> **The B1 count law pins the readout VALUE-SET cardinality (`= n`); it does NOT bound the
> worst-case far-line incidence, which remains the OPEN δ* object.**

## What this file proves (honest, axiom-clean)

* `topDirectionValueCount_eq_n` — re-exports the proven B1 `= n` value count (the wired fact).
* `WorstCaseFarIncidenceBounded` — the EXACT δ* object as a NAMED OPEN `Prop`: for every far
  stack the incidence count is `≤ budget`.  This is the open obligation; it is NOT discharged
  here.
* `epsMCA_le_of_worstCaseFarIncidence` — the genuine, non-circular bridge: IF
  `WorstCaseFarIncidenceBounded` holds at `budget = B`, THEN the far-line bad-`γ` count is
  `≤ B` (so dividing by `q` caps `epsMCA`).  The incidence bound is a HYPOTHESIS, not a
  consequence of the value count.
* `epsMCA_pinch_of_worstCaseFarIncidence` — the pinch: the SAME incidence count both
  lower-bounds `epsMCA` (proven, via `FarCosetExplosion.epsMCA_ge_far_incidence`) and is
  upper-bounded by the open `B`, with no circularity.  Setting `B = ⌊q·ε*⌋` is the δ* ceiling.
* `worstCaseIncidence_is_the_open_object` — the ANTI-CONFLATION witness: the δ* object is the
  separate `WorstCaseFarIncidenceBounded`, type-checked so that downstream code cannot silently
  substitute the value count `= n` for the incidence bound (the value count being `n` entails NO
  bound on the incidence; numeric separation above).

`B` at radius `δ` (the named open obligation `WorstCaseFarIncidenceBounded`), then for every far

  `epsMCA C δ ≤ B / q`.

This is a clean *consequence* of the incidence bound via
`FarCosetExplosion.epsMCA_ge_far_incidence` read in the contrapositive direction — i.e. the
incidence bound `B` caps the bad-`γ` count, which caps `q·ε_mca`.  The bound `B` is an INPUT
(the open obligation), never derived from the B1 value count.  Setting `B = ⌊q·ε*⌋` gives the
`δ*` upper-bound rung. -/

/-! ## Part 3 — the ANTI-CONFLATION statement: value count ≠ worst-case incidence. -/

/-- **ANTI-CONFLATION (the explicit non-implication).**  The B1 value count `= n` and the
worst-case far-line incidence are *logically independent* objects.  Formally: knowing the
top-direction readout value-set has cardinality `n` gives NO information about the worst-case
incidence — there is no theorem of the form "value count `= n` ⟹ incidence `≤ f(n)`".

We record this as the honest negative fact that the open obligation
`WorstCaseFarIncidenceBounded` is NOT implied by the value-count law: it is a *separate* Prop,
left open.  The numeric witnesses (file header) show the incidence binder (`9, 13, 89` for
`n=8,12,16`) is neither the value count (`8, 12, 16`) nor the value-fiber (`7, 43, 273`), so any
purported equality among the three is refuted.

This lemma is intentionally a tautology over the named Prop — its CONTENT is the statement, in
type-checked form, that the δ* object is the separate `WorstCaseFarIncidenceBounded`, not the
value count.  It exists so that downstream code cannot silently substitute one for the other. -/
