# Closed form for the over-determined far-line incidence MAX (#407, δ* decoupling)

This file records the **closed form** of the over-determined far-line incidence MAX for the
prize-regime thin 2-power subgroup `μ_n ⊊ F_q^×` (`n = 2^μ`), in the rate `k = 2`,
over-determined witness size `s = k + 2 = 4` (`s − k = 2`), and the structural inequality that
makes it matter for the δ* decoupling.

## Background (the δ* decoupling, char-0 / p-independent)

The far-line incidence `I(a,b ; r = n−s)` counts the `γ` with `x^a + γ x^b` within distance `r`
of `RS[μ_n, k]`. For `s − k ≥ 2` (over-determined) it is **p-independent** (= its char-0 value,
proven via `disc(x^{2^μ} − 1) = ± n^n` a power of `2`), so the binding witness size
`s* = min { s : I(s) ≤ budget }` is computed in pure cyclotomic char-0 data and δ* decouples from
the open p-dependent BGK character-sum max. The single remaining char-0 open item is the
asymptotic `s*(n,k)` of the over-determined incidence threshold.

## This file's contribution: the MAX is an exact cubic, and it dominates budget

The empirical, exactly-reproduced (probe `probe_overdet_max_closedform.py`,
`probe_overdet_antipodal_only.py`, `probe_overdet_mechanism.py`; full-direction search and exact
integer cross-check) over-determined incidence MAX at `s = k + 2`, `k = 2`, is

> **`I_max(n) = n³/32 − n²/8 + 1`**,  written here with `n = 4·m` as **`2·m³ − 2·m² + 1`**,

attained at the **antipodal direction `(a,b) = (n/2, n/2 − 1)`**. Verified EXACTLY for
`n = 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40` (`m = 2 … 10`), reproducing the campaign's published
sequence `9, 37, 97, 201, 361, 589, 897, 1297, 1801`. The mechanism: the bulk `2m³ − 2m²` are the
nonzero-`γ` proportional-reduction witnesses; the `+1` is exactly the trivial `γ = 0` witness (the
unique `γ` with an antipodal-closed witness set).

We formalize:
* `overdetIncidenceMax m := 2*m^3 - 2*m^2 + 1` — the closed form (`ℕ`, in terms of `m = n/4`);
* `overdetIncidenceMax_values` — it matches the published sequence on `m = 2 … 10` (`decide`);
* **`overdetIncidenceMax_gt_budget`** — `overdetIncidenceMax m > 4*m` for `m ≥ 2`, i.e. the
  over-determined incidence MAX **strictly exceeds the budget `n = 4·m`**. This is the quantitative
  form of "the binding `s*` is always over-determined", the inequality underpinning the δ*
  decoupling. (`budget ~ n`; here exactly `n = 4m` at `k = 2`.)

**Scope / honesty.** This is the EXACT closed form of the over-determined incidence MAX (an
empirical cyclotomic count, reproduced exactly at every probed `n`), and a fully-proved arithmetic
domination over budget. It is NOT a closure of CORE: it pins one ingredient (the over-det MAX curve)
that the open `s*(n,k)` asymptotic still needs (the MAX is at `s = k+2`; the budget-crossing `s*`
requires the full `s`-dependence). The closed form's *cyclotomic derivation* is not formalized here
(only its arithmetic and the domination); the value is established by exact computation.

/-- **The δ* decoupling inequality (quantitative).** For `m ≥ 2` (i.e. `n = 4m ≥ 8`, the regime
where over-determination `s − k ≥ 2` is nondegenerate), the over-determined incidence MAX
**strictly exceeds the budget** `n = 4·m`:

> `overdetIncidenceMax m > 4·m`.

Since the over-determined incidence MAX `≫ budget` at `s = k+2` for every `m ≥ 2`, the binding
witness size `s*` (the first `s` whose incidence drops to `≤ budget`) can never be the
over-determined boundary `s = k+2`; the incidence stays above budget there. This is the arithmetic
core of "the binding is always over-determined ⟹ δ* is p-independent" (decoupled from the
p-dependent BGK max), proven outright over `ℕ`. -/
