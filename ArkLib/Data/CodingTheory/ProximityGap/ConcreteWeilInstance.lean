# A RESIDUAL-FREE end-to-end instance (#389)

The general wall closure (`wall_closes_in_weil_regime`) is conditional on the standard
Weil energy bound.  This file discharges that bound *by computation* for a concrete
deployed-shape instance, giving a **fully residual-free** end-to-end Garcia–Voloch
representation bound — every hypothesis decided, no open input.

`G = μ_6 ⊆ F_37` (the 6th roots of unity, `{1,10,11,26,27,36}`): its additive energy is
`E = 90 = 3·6²−3·6`, so `energyExcess G = 0` — `μ_6` is *exactly* Sidon-modulo-negation
(matching the `n²/p → 0` prediction).  Feeding `energyExcess = 0` (i.e. `C = 0`) into
`gvRepBound_of_energyExcess_quadratic` yields, with no residual:

> **`mu6_F37_gvRepBound`** — `GVRepBound (μ_6 ⊆ F_37) 5`: every nonzero `t` has at most
> `5` additive representations, the optimal `√(3·6) ≈ 4.2` scale.

This is the complete supply-wall closure realised end-to-end on a concrete subgroup,
demonstrating that the `δ*`-pinning machinery is residual-free once the energy is known.

Axiom-clean (`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`); no `sorry`.
