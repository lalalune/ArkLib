# Round 14b (Issue #232) — the EXACT reach of the averaging method: the matching no-go

Round 14 (`DeltaStarConstantGapBelowCapacity`) proved the averaging list lower bound
`maxList(1−(k+t)/n) ≥ C(n,k+t)/q^t` beats the prize threshold `ε*·|F|` for `t ≲ n/258` (rate 1/2,
fields up to `2^256`). This file proves the **matching method no-go**: for near-maximal prize
fields (`q ≥ 2^255`), the averaging *bound itself* is provably below the threshold once
`t ≥ (n−127)/255` — because `C(n,a) ≤ 2^n` caps the numerator while `q^t` grows by `≥ 255` bits
per step.

Together the two results pin the averaging method's reach to the window

  `t/n ∈ [~1/258 works, ~1/255 provably exhausted]`   (rate 1/2, `q ≈ 2^256`),

a ~1% indeterminacy: **Round 14 is essentially optimal for the averaging route, and the route is
now closed as a method.** Any refutation deeper into the interior (larger `t`, smaller `δ`)
requires a non-averaging input (concentration — provably symmetry-impossible by the
depth-collapse wall — or genuinely new counting).

Honest scope: this bounds the averaging *lower bound* `C(n,k+t)/q^t`, not the true list size; the
true list could exceed the threshold deeper in — deciding that is (part of) the open prize.

/-- **The averaging-method no-go.** For near-maximal prize fields (`2^255 ≤ q`) and depth
`t` with `n + 128 ≤ 255·(t+1)` (i.e. `t ≥ (n−127)/255`), the averaging numerator is provably
below the prize threshold in the exact multiplicative form:

  `C(n, k+t) · 2^128 ≤ q^{t+1}`,

equivalently `C(n,k+t)/q^t ≤ q/2^128 = ε*·|F|` — the averaging lower bound cannot reach the
threshold. Combined with Round 14 (`crossover_rate_half`: the bound DOES exceed the threshold for
`258t + 193 ≤ n`), the averaging method's reach at `q ≈ 2^256` is pinned to within ~1%. -/

`t = 4063` (Round 14, `258·4063+193 ≤ 2^20`) and is *provably exhausted* at `t = 4112`
(`2^20 + 128 ≤ 255·4113`). The method's exact reach is trapped in `t ∈ (4063, 4112]` — a window
of width `49/2^20 < 0.005%` of the radius. -/
