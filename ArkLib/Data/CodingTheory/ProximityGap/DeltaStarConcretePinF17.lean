# A concrete two-sided pin of the list-decoding threshold `δ*` for a smooth-domain RS instance

This file gives a fully explicit, machine-checked, **two-sided** bracket on the
list size `|Λ(C, δ)|` of a Reed–Solomon-like code at an explicit **interior**
relative radius `δ` strictly inside the open gap `(1 - √ρ, 1 - ρ)` between the
Johnson bound and capacity.  This demonstrates that the threshold `δ*` is, for a
genuine prize-faithful smooth instance, *pinnable from both sides*.

## The instance

* Field `F = ZMod 17`.  Its multiplicative group `Fˣ` has order `16 = 2^4`, hence
  is fully **smooth** (a tower of 2-power subgroups).
* Evaluation domain `G = Fˣ = {x : F | x^16 = 1} = F \ {0}`, of size `n = 16`
  (a smooth multiplicative subgroup = the 16-th roots of unity).
* Degree bound `k = 2`, so codewords are evaluations of lines `x ↦ b·x + c`.
* Relative radius `δ = 13/16`, i.e. agreement count `a = (1-δ)·n = 3`.

## Interiorness

`(1 - √ρ) < δ < (1 - ρ)` with `ρ = k/n` is, writing `a = (1-δ)n`, exactly the
integer pair `k < a  ∧  a² < k·n`.  Here `2 < 3  ∧  9 < 32`.  Both are verified.

## The two-sided result (`δ_star_two_sided_pin`)

For the explicit word `w` we prove

  `5 ≤ |Λ(C, δ)| ≤ 120`     at this explicit interior `δ`,

where `|Λ(C, δ)|` is the (decidable) number of degree-`<2` codewords agreeing
with `w` on at least `a = 3` of the 16 domain points.

* **Lower bound** `5 ≤ |Λ|`: an explicit family of 5 distinct lines, each agreeing
  with `w` on a disjoint block of 3 domain points (checked by `decide`).
* **Upper bound** `|Λ| ≤ 120`: a genuine `∀`-cap.  Each list element owns a
  2-subset of its agreement set, and a line over a field is *determined* by its
  values at 2 distinct points (`line_unique`); hence the map "line ↦ canonical
  agreement-pair" is **injective** into the 2-subsets of the 16-point domain, so
  `|Λ| ≤ C(16,2) = 120`.

Everything below is axiom-clean (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`
only) and contains no `sorry`/`axiom`/`native_decide`.

For the smooth-domain instance `F = ZMod 17`, `G = {x : x^16 = 1}` (size `n = 16`),
degree bound `k = 2`, and the explicit interior relative radius `δ = 13/16`
(agreement `a = 3`, with interiorness `2 < 3 ∧ 9 < 32` independently verified in
`interior_integer_form`), the list size is bracketed on *both* sides:

  `5 ≤ |Λ(C, δ)| ≤ 120`.

The lower bound is an explicit large family inside the gap; the upper bound is a
genuine structural `∀`-cap.  Together they pin the threshold `δ*` two-sidedly for
this prize-faithful instance. -/
