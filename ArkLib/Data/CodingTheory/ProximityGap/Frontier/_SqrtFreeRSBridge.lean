# Attack 3: the √-free RS bridge — ABF Thm 5.1 + RS structure (issue #407)

## Where the √ enters GCXK25 Thm 3 (= ABF Thm 5.1)

ABF Thm 5.1 / [GCXK25] Thm 3 (eprint 2025/870): if `C` is `(δ, L)`-list-decodable then
`ε_mca(C, 1 − √(1−δ) + η) ≤ (L²·δ·n + 1/η)/|F|`. The `√` is the **Johnson transform**
`J(δ) = 1 − √(1−δ)` of the *agreement fraction* (`Def 3.1` of ABF: `J(δ) = lim_q J_q(δ)`).
It enters at the generic second-moment / pairwise-list step: bounding the number of pairs of
list-codewords with large pairwise agreement is a Cauchy–Schwarz (collision-counting) estimate
(ABF's own such step, §A, "applying Cauchy–Schwarz" + Jensen, lines 2321/2333), and the resulting
`|S|² / (2·collisions + |S|)` lower bound on the image size produces the `√` when inverted to a
radius. This is the **same** L²→L∞ loss as the BGK 2r-th-root `‖η_b‖^{2r} ≤ q·E_r` and the W2
second moment `T² ≤ |G|·E`. ABF p.1192: removing it "would reestablish all known results", but it
"cannot hold in general" — the GCXK25 reduction is generic for *any* linear code, so it must pay the
worst-case Johnson √ (tight for general codes, [Gur02; GS03]); the open question is the RS special case.

## The RS-specific property that removes the √

For **plain RS on a smooth domain** there is an *exact* far-line incidence identity that the generic
proof has no access to. The far monomial direction `u₁ = X^k` is **nowhere zero** on `μ_n`
(smoothness) and the line `u₀ + γ·X^k` meeting a degree-`<k` codeword on a coordinate set `S` is, by
the **+1-degree lift** (`MonomialLineListBridge.badScalars_monomial_eq_degreeLTSucc`), the *same* as a
degree-`<k+1` codeword (with `X^k`-coefficient `−γ`) meeting `u₀` on `S` — **at the same radius `δ`**.
So:

* **No radius map.** RS[k] bad-count at radius `δ` ↔ RS[k+1] agreement-list at radius `δ`. The
  Johnson transform `δ ↦ 1−√(1−δ)` is *gone* — both sides use the identical `δ`.
* **Linear, not L².** The fiber count (`LineCodewordIncidence.line_codeword_incidence_le`: a
  nowhere-zero direction meets a *fixed* word on `≥ w` coords for at most `⌊n/w⌋` scalars `γ`) bounds
  the incidence by `⌊n/w⌋ · L` — **linear** in the list size, not `L²`. The Cauchy–Schwarz pairwise
  step is replaced by a deterministic per-codeword fiber partition of `Fin n`.

Hence the in-tree `epsMCA_ge_far_incidence` is *literally* the RS-special, √-removed avatar of ABF
Thm 5.1: it equates `ε_mca` with `#bad/q` exactly (`= I_far/q`), and the monomial bridge bounds
`#bad ≤ L_{RS[k+1]}(δ)` at the **same** `δ`, with no √ and a linear-in-`L` constant.

## The √-free RS bridge (this file)

`epsMCA_le_listSize_div`: on the far stratum, for the monomial far line `(u₀, X^k)`,

  `ε_mca(RS[k], δ) ≥ #bad/q`   (lower, `epsMCA_ge_far_incidence`)   and
  `#bad ≤ |list_{RS[k+1]}(u₀, δ)|`   (upper, `badScalars_monomial_card_le_listSize`),

both at the **identical radius `δ`**. Composing, the MCA bad-count is sandwiched *linearly* by the
`+1`-lifted list size — the √-free statement. **What remains** is exactly `L_{RS[k+1]}(δ)` — the
list-decoding size of `RS[μ_n, k+1]` beyond the Johnson bound, which is the *other* grand challenge
(and the only genuinely open quantity; cf. `LineCodewordIncidence` docstring). The √ is removed for
the RS special case; the open content has been transported, not eliminated.

/-- **The √-free RS bridge (ABF Thm 5.1 specialised to plain RS on a smooth domain).**

For the monomial far line `(u₀, X^k)` (smooth direction `X^k`, nowhere zero on `μ_n`) that is far
from `RS[k]` at radius `δ`, the MCA error is sandwiched **at the identical radius `δ`** between the
bad-scalar incidence over `q` and the size of the `+1`-degree-lifted `RS[k+1]` agreement list:

  `(#bad : ℝ≥0∞)/q ≤ ε_mca(RS[k], δ)`   with   `#bad ≤ |liftedList|`.

In particular `ε_mca(RS[k], δ) ≥ (#bad)/q` and `#bad` is **linear** in the `RS[k+1]` list size
`L := |liftedList|` — no `√(1−δ)` radius map, no `L²`. The Johnson transform and the pairwise
Cauchy–Schwarz of the generic GCXK25 reduction are both removed by the RS fiber-count identity.
The only residual is the open list size `L = |liftedList|` of `RS[k+1]` beyond Johnson. -/
