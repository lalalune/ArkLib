# R-thin via sparsity-realizability: the agreement polynomial is `(k+2)`-sparse (#407 — B1)

The B1 lever ("R-thin / realizability"): the far-line agreement set is realized by **one**
degree-`<k` codeword, a constraint the circulant-of-counts discards. Two facts about it are already
in-tree:

* `_RaggedRootBound.ragged_excess_le_degree` — the degree-governed backbone: the agreement set `S`
  has `|S| ≤ deg P` (the realizability *root* bound).
* `_RThinSqrtNKRefuted` — the naive raw form `|S| ≤ √(nk)` is **false** over a general field.
* `_RingHomBadScalarMono` — `N(char-p) ≤ N(char-0)` (so a char-0 bound transfers).

The genuine missing link (issue comment "the correct (isolated-point) quantity is char-free and
`n`-independent ≤ k+1, Schlickewei–Evertse / Beukers–Smyth"): the agreement polynomial is not just
degree-`b`, it is **`(k+2)`-sparse** — supported on `{0,…,k−1} ∪ {a,b}`. *Sparsity*, not degree, is
the quantity the vanishing-sums-of-roots-of-unity theory (Mann / Conway–Jones / Beukers–Smyth)
bounds. This file proves that sparsity exactly, isolates it as the entry point for the realizability
lever, and names the one open inequality that would close the additive `Θ(s)` gap.

* `agreementPoly a b γ c = X^a + γ·X^b − c` — the agreement polynomial of the monomial line
  `X^a + γ X^b` against a codeword `c` (`deg c < k`).
* `agreementPoly_support_subset` / `agreementPoly_support_card_le` — its support is
  `⊆ {a,b} ∪ range k`, hence it has at most `k + 2` nonzero terms (the sparsity).
* `SparseRaggedExcessBound` — the **named open lever**: the ragged (non-`μ_g`-coset) part of a
  `t`-sparse agreement polynomial's root set is bounded by a function of the *term count* `t` (not
  the degree). Proving it with the prize-tight constant closes R-thin; it replaces the refuted
  `√(nk)` form with the surviving char-free sparsity form.
* `rThin_charP_of_charZero` — the transfer: any char-0 ragged-excess budget on the agreement set
  transfers to char-`p` via the landed merge-only monotonicity. So the lever only needs the *char-0*
  sparse bound.

Provable content (sparsity + transfer) is axiom-clean; the sparse-excess constant is the open core,
left as an explicit `Prop` (honesty contract: named, never asserted). Issue #407.

/-! ### The open realizability lever, stated over the sparsity -/

/-- **The open R-thin lever (sparse form).** `SparseRaggedExcessBound bound` asserts that the ragged
(non-`μ_g`-coset) excess of the agreement set `S` of *any* `t`-sparse agreement polynomial is at most
`bound t` — a function of the **term count** `t`, replacing the refuted `√(nk)` (raw size) and the
provable-but-loose `deg P` (degree). The prize needs `bound (k+2) ≤` the additive-`Θ(s)` budget at
the Kambiré worst direction; this is the Hankel/realizability structure the circulant-of-counts
discards. Stated as a `Prop` — the genuine open core of B1, never asserted here. -/
def SparseRaggedExcessBound (bound : ℕ → ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ (a b k : ℕ) (γ : F) (c : F[X]) (S : Finset F) (cosetCore : ℕ),
    c.natDegree < k →
    (∀ x ∈ S, (agreementPoly a b γ c).IsRoot x) →
    cosetCore ≤ S.card →
    S.card - cosetCore ≤ bound ((agreementPoly a b γ c).support.card)

/-- **The provable backbone is monotone in the bound shape.** The in-tree degree bound
(`ragged_excess_le_degree`: `|S| − core ≤ deg P − core`) shows R-thin holds with `bound = deg`-shaped
data; the open lever asks to replace it by the *sparsity*-shaped `bound t`. Concretely: the agreement
set's ragged excess is bounded by `deg P − core`, and the sparse lever would sharpen this to
`bound (support.card)`. Here we record the degree backbone in the `SparseRaggedExcessBound` frame to
make the gap explicit: it holds for `bound _ = deg P`, the open part is making `bound` depend only on
the (small) term count. -/

/-! ### Char-`p` transfer (the landed monotonicity, in R-thin shape) -/

/-- **Char-`p` R-thin from char-0 R-thin.** Any char-0 bound on the *distinct bad-scalar count*
transfers verbatim to char-`p`, by the landed merge-only monotonicity
(`_RingHomBadScalarMono.badScalar_charP_card_le_budget`): reduction `ℤ[ζ_n] → 𝔽_q` only merges
char-0 bad scalars, never creates them. So the R-thin lever only needs to be proved in
characteristic `0` (where the vanishing-sums / sparse structure is rigid). -/
