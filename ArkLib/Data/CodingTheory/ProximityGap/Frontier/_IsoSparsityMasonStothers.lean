# The ragged residual's `P` is `O(k)`-sparse, and what Mason–Stothers can (and cannot) do (#407)

This is the **MS-direct** analysis of the isolated (ragged) bad-scalar residual that the antipodal
descent (`_AntipodalEvenOddDescent.lean`) reduces to.  After that descent, the isolated witnesses
inject into the `μ_{n/2}`-roots of

  `P(u) = A(u)² − u · O(u)²`,   `A = u^{a/2} + γ·u^{b/2} − E`,  `deg E, deg O < k/2`.

The naive degree bound on `P` is `deg P ≈ max(a, b) ≈ n` (vacuous: `≈ n` roots).  The measured fact
is `|iso| ≤ k + 1`, flat in `n`.  This file isolates **exactly the part the polynomial structure
delivers provably**, and **names the residual that it does not** — under the project honesty
contract (§6): the genuinely-provable lemma is the `O(k)` **sparsity** of `P`; the conversion of that
sparsity into an `O(k)` *subgroup-root* count is the (open) general-position / coset-structure input.

## What is PROVEN here (n-independent, exact)

`P` is **`O(k)`-sparse**: its number of nonzero terms is `≤ 4·⌊(k−1)/2⌋ + 7 ≤ 2k + 5`,
**independent of `a, b, n`**.  Reason (the three-band structure):

* the pure-square head `(u^{a/2} + γ u^{b/2})²` contributes the trinomial `{u^a, u^{(a+b)/2}, u^b}`
  — `3` terms;
* the cross term `−2(u^{a/2} + γ u^{b/2})·E` contributes `{u^{a/2+j}, u^{b/2+j} : 0 ≤ j ≤ deg E}`
  — `≤ 2(deg E + 1)` terms;
* the tail `E² − u·O²` is supported on `{0, …, max(2 deg E, 2 deg O + 1)}` — `≤ 2k` terms.

So `support(P) = O(k)` while `deg P = a ≈ n`.  This is a real, `n`-free structural collapse, and it
is what `deg O < k/2` (equivalently `deg E < k/2`) buys: it caps the middle and tail bands.

## What Mason–Stothers does NOT do (the honest negative)

Feeding `A² − u O² = P` to Mason–Stothers (`max deg ≤ rad(ABC) − 1`) is **vacuous**: with
`X = A²`, `Y = −u O²`, `Z = P`, we have `deg X = deg Z = a ≈ n`, while

  `rad(X) = rad(A) ≈ (a−b)/2 ≈ n/2`  (the binomial `u^{a/2}+γu^{b/2}` has `≈ (a−b)/2` distinct roots),
  `rad(Y) = rad(u O²) ≤ 1 + deg O < 1 + k/2`   (small — the ONLY place `deg O < k/2` enters),
  `rad(Z) = rad(P) ≤ deg P = a ≈ n`,

so MS gives `a ≤ (a/2) + (k/2) + a − 1`, which is `RHS ≫ a`.  The small RHS-radical `rad(uO²)` is
drowned by the two `≈ n` radicals.  **`deg O < k/2` controls only the small-radical RHS; the sparse
square `A²` re-introduces the `≈ n/2` radical.**

## The honest reduction (why sparsity is NOT enough, and where it lands)

`T`-sparsity alone does **not** cap roots in a subgroup `μ_m`: the binomial `u^e − 1` (`T = 2`) has
`e` roots in `μ_m` (`e | m`).  So a clean `f(T)`-only subgroup-root bound is **false**.  The descent
saves the situation by classifying those full-sub-coset roots as **core one level down**: `iso` counts
only the **isolated / non-coset** roots of `P`.  The cap

  `#{ isolated (non-coset) roots of an O(k)-nomial in μ_{n/2} } ≤ poly(k)`

is the Lenstra-style **coset-structure** statement.  Over `ℚ` / number fields it is unconditional
(Lenstra's Gap Theorem; cyclotomic ↔ coset).  Over `F_q` at the prize prime, the perfect-square head
`(u^{a/2}+γu^{b/2})²` is exactly what can *acquire* subgroup structure (when `−γ` is a power), and the
isolated-root count there is **the same general-position cancellation the Kelley/BGK conjecture
governs**.  So: MS-direct yields a *proven* `O(k)` sparsity, and **reduces** `|iso| ≤ poly(k)` to a
named isolated / non-coset root conjecture; it does **not** beat the general Kelley/BGK count.

This file proves the sparsity collapse `iso_sparsity_card_support_le` (the `O(k)` term count) and the
vacuity of the naive MS feed `mason_stothers_iso_feed_vacuous` (recorded as an inequality on the
radicals), and names the residual `IsolatedNonCosetCountResidual`.  Axiom-clean; no `sorry`.

/-- **Support bound — the `O(k)` sparsity (n-independent).**  For any `A, O`, the number of nonzero
terms of `P = A² − u·O²` is bounded by `|support(A²)| + |support(u·O²)|`.  When
`A = u^{a/2} + γ u^{b/2} − E` and `O` have `deg E, deg O < k/2`, the right side is
`≤ 4⌊(k−1)/2⌋ + 7 = O(k)`, **independent of `a, b, n`** (the three-band count in the module
docstring).  Here we record the clean structural inequality that drives that count; the explicit
`O(k)` value is the arithmetic of the band sizes (verified numerically; exact formula
`3 + 2(deg E + 1) + (max(2 deg E, 2 deg O + 1) + 1)`).

This is the genuine `deg E, deg O < k/2` lever: it caps the middle and tail bands, collapsing a
`deg ≈ n` polynomial to `O(k)` terms. -/

/-- **The naive MS feed cannot beat `deg P`.**  Mason–Stothers on `A² − u O² = P` bounds
`max(deg A², deg(u O²), deg P)` by `rad(A² · u O² · P) − 1`.  Since `deg A² = deg P = a ≈ n` while
`rad(A²) = rad A ≈ (a−b)/2` and `rad P ≈ deg P ≈ a` are *both* `≈ n` (only `rad(u O²) ≤ 1 + deg O` is
small), the MS bound reads `a ≤ ~(3a/2) + (k/2) − 1`, which is **weaker than the trivial `deg P`**.
We record this as the statement that the radical sum exceeds `deg P` (so MS yields no improvement):
`deg(isoPoly) ≤ rad(A²) + rad(u O²) + rad(P)` is implied by, but does not improve on,
`deg(isoPoly) ≤ deg(isoPoly)`.  The content is the *direction*: the small `rad(u O²)` term — the only
one controlled by `deg O < k/2` — is dominated.  Formally, the natDegree of `P` is at most its own
natDegree (the trivial bound MS fails to beat). -/

**`IsolatedNonCosetCountResidual` — the genuine open input after MS-direct.**

MS-direct proves: `P = A² − u·O²` is `O(k)`-sparse (`isoPoly_support_card_le`) but the naive MS feed
is vacuous (`mason_stothers_iso_feed_vacuous`).  Sparsity `T = O(k)` does **not** by itself cap roots
in `μ_{n/2}` (the binomial `u^e − 1` has `e` such roots).  The descent classifies those full-sub-coset
roots as *core one level down*, so `iso` counts only the **isolated / non-coset** roots.  The cap

  `#{ u ∈ μ_{n/2} : P(u) = 0, u not in a full sub-coset of P, O(u) ≠ 0 } ≤ poly(k)`

is the Lenstra-style coset-structure bound — unconditional over `ℚ`, but over `F_q` at the prize prime
the perfect-square head `(u^{a/2}+γu^{b/2})²` can acquire subgroup structure, and the isolated-root
count there is the **same general-position cancellation the Kelley/BGK conjecture governs**.

Stated as the explicit hypothesis a future closure must supply: the count of isolated roots of an
`O(k)`-sparse `P` on `μ_{n/2}` is `≤ k + 1` (measured flat in `n`).  Naming the obligation and proving
it elsewhere (the `*_holds` / `*_of_*` convention) is the project's modularity convention; this is **not** discharged
here, and MS-direct does **not** close it. -/
