# wf-S4 — the Galois ORBIT-partition law: per-prime count is UNIFORM = (#orbits) (#444)

This sharpens `_wfS4_galois_perprime_spread.lean`. That file proves the Fubini identity
`Σ_a perPrime a = Σ_T spread T` and, in the measured `spread ≡ 1` regime, that the total incidence
equals the number of landing configs. **This file proves the exact `(n/2)×` SPREAD LAW behind the
prize CONCENTRATION mechanism** by adding the *orbit-transitivity* structure that the probes
measured, abstracted to its combinatorial core.

## The exact measured law (probe `probe_wfS4_perprime_law.py`, EXACT, prize-shaped `p ≍ n^β`)

`p ≡ 1 mod n` splits completely in `ℤ[ζ_n]` into the `φ(n) = n/2` primes `𝔭_a` (`a ∈ G := (ℤ/n)^×`),
on which `G` acts **simply transitively**. A spurious config `T` (antipodal-free signed subset of
`μ_n` with `p ∣ N(σ_T)`) lands in the set `Land(T) ⊆ G`. The probe found, at the *worst* structured
prime in each band, EXACTLY:

| n | worst p | β | total spur (any prime) | per-prime `c(𝔭₁)` | ratio | orbit sizes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8  | 73  | 2.06 | 0 | 0 | — | — |
| 16 | 401 | 2.16 | 64 | 8 | **8 = n/2** | all **8** (full) |

i.e. (i) **`spread t(T) = 1`** — each config lands in exactly ONE prime; (ii) the landing configs
fall into **full Galois orbits of size `|G| = n/2`** — one config per prime; hence (iii)
**`perPrime a = #orbits` for EVERY prime `a`** (uniform), and `total = (n/2) · #orbits`.
Two further EXACT facts (probes `probe_wfS4_orbit_growth`, `_galois_perprime_spread`):
- **Stickelberger multiplicity pin: `v_{𝔭_a}(σ_T) = 1` always** (max valuation 1 over all measured
  n ∈ {8,16,32}, all weights ≤ 6) — vanishing is always SIMPLE; no config concentrates depth in one
  prime.
- **β-sweep collapse: at prize β (≥ 3) the bounded-weight spurious mass is `0`** (n=16: p=4129 (β=3),
  p=65537=Fermat (β=4) both have `0` weight-≤4 spurious configs; the structured bad primes for SHORT
  relations sit at SMALL β). So the energy inflation at structured primes (the S2 Fermat 2.58× at r=2)
  comes from HIGH-weight (`≈ 2r`, collision-heavy) configs, NOT bounded-weight ones — exactly the
  "spread over many frequencies, not concentrated" signature.

## What this file proves (axiom-clean), the ORBIT-partition / uniform-per-prime law

Abstracted: `G` a finite group (the Galois group), acting on a config set `C`; the *landing prime*
of a config is a function `home : C → G` (well-defined because `spread ≡ 1`), and the action is
modeled by a `G`-action `act : G → C → C` that is **`home`-equivariant**: `home (act g T) = g • home T`
in the regular `G`-torsor sense `home (act g T) = g * home T`. Then:

> **`perPrime_eq_of_torsor`** — if `home` is `G`-equivariant onto the regular `G`-action on itself
> and `act` is a free transitive action on each fibre's orbit, then `perPrime a` is **independent of
> `a`** (every prime sees the same number of configs) and equals `(#landing configs) / |G|`. This is
> the exact `1/(n/2)` per-prime concentration, now a THEOREM (given the measured `home`-equivariance),
> not just an average.

We give the load-bearing piece as a clean bijection: the fibre `home⁻¹(a)` is in bijection with the
fibre `home⁻¹(b)` for any two primes `a b`, via translation by `b a⁻¹` through the equivariant action.
Hence all fibres (`= perPrime a`) have equal cardinality.

## Honest scope (rules 1, 3, 6)

NOT a CORE closure. This is the EXACT Galois-orbit bookkeeping making the prompt's CONCENTRATION
mechanism precise: at a structured prime the TOTAL config count inflates, but it is spread UNIFORMLY
over the `n/2` split primes (per-prime `= total/(n/2)`), and per-prime each vanishing is simple
(`v_𝔭 = 1`). The equivariance input `home (act g T) = g * home T` is the MEASURED `spread ≡ 1` +
simple-transitivity fact (probe), not proven here. CORE (`M(μ_n) ≤ C·√(n·log(p/n))`) stays **OPEN**;
this constrains HOW the spurious mass can be distributed, supporting (does not prove) the bounded-`M`
spread picture.

Summing the uniform per-prime count over the `|G| = n/2` primes recovers the total number of landing

spurious configs — the exact `(n/2)×` SPREAD the probe measured (`total = 64 = 8 · 8 = (n/2) · c`). -/
