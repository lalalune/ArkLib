Atk_R6 : Bezout-on-the-relation-variety conjecture (R6) — structural no-go.

R6 CLAIM: W_r = #F_p-points of the weight-2r relation variety V_r
  (sum_{i<=r} (zeta^{a_i} - zeta^{b_i}) = 0), a 0-dim complete intersection
  whose Bezout DEGREE is bounded by a product <= (2r)!*small, forcing
  E_r <= (2r-1)!! n^r (the prize energy bound).

(A) MISIDENTIFICATION. #V_r(F_p) = E_r (full additive energy), NOT W_r. Verified
    exactly on proper thin mu_n (n=4,8,16; r<=5; p=1 mod n, p>>n^3): all 15 cases.
(B) BEZOUT IS THE WRONG DIRECTION. Ambient (mu_n)^{2r} is a 0-dim CI {x_i^n=1} of
    degree n^{2r}; one linear cut gives at best n^{2r-1} points. We PROVE
        (2r-1)!! * n^r  <=  n^{2r-1}   whenever  (2r-1)!! <= n^{r-1}.
    In prize regime (n=2^30, r<=120) hypothesis holds with astronomical margin, so
    Bezout bound is STRICTLY ABOVE Wick — cannot force E_r <= Wick. R6 refuted.
(C) W_r is p-DEPENDENT (n=32,r=5: +445036032,-525950208,+714212352,+2910765312 over
    four primes p=1 mod 32); a Bezout degree is p-independent, so cannot equal it.
R6 REDUCES to the moment/energy char-p wall (the Spur excess W_r) = DEAD CLASS.
