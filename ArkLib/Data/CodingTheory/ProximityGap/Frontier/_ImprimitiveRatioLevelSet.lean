# The imprimitive ratio-census level-set law (the inverse-Littlewood–Offord brick, #407 D3)

Companion / sharpening of `RatioLevelSet.lean` and `RatioCensusWeightIdentity.lean`.

`RatioCensusWeightIdentity.lean` lands the exact char-sum-free identity
`wt(s₀ + γ·s₁) = n − z₀ − ratioMult s₀ s₁ γ`, where
`ratioMult γ = #{i ∈ supp(s₁) : −s₀ᵢ/s₁ᵢ = γ}` is the multiplicity of `γ` in the ratio
sequence.  `RatioLevelSet.lean` lands the **generic** upper bound: for a GRS line the ratio is a
rational function so any level set is a root set, hence `ratioMult γ ≤ max (deg s₀) (deg s₁)`.

The D3 thread (issue #407 comment 199) pins that the *worst-case* far-line incidence is attained
on the **imprimitive** monomial directions `r(x) = −x^d` on the smooth subgroup `μ_n` (`n = 2^μ`),
where the per-value multiplicity *collapses* onto the Gauss period — the BGK object.  This file
isolates the elementary, char-free, **exact** (sharp both directions — the inverse-LO content) law
behind that collapse:

> **The ratio sequence of `r = −x^d` on the cyclic group `μ_n` is the power map `x ↦ x^d`, whose
> nonempty fibers are *exactly* the cosets of `ker = μ_{gcd(n,d)}`.** Hence every attained value has
> multiplicity **exactly** `gcd(n, d)` (not merely `≤`), and the number of attained values (the
> high-multiplicity level-set count, i.e. the inverse-LO concentration count) is **exactly**
> `n / gcd(n, d)`.

Stated for an abstract finite cyclic group `G` (the smooth subgroup `μ_n` is the running model):

* `imprimitive_fiber_card` — every nonempty fiber of `x ↦ x^d` has card `gcd(card G, d)`.
  This is the **sharp** `ratioMult`: the per-value multiplicity is forced to be exactly the gcd, so
  the imprimitive direction *cannot* spread its multiplicity below `gcd(n,d)` — anti-concentration
  is impossible, concentration is forced.  (The inverse-LO statement: high `ratioMult` is *not* a
  rare accident here, it is structural.)
* `imprimitive_image_card` — the number of distinct attained ratio values is
  `card G / gcd(card G, d)` (the count of high-multiplicity level sets).
* `imprimitive_highmult_levelset_card` — the clean inverse-LO level-set count: for any threshold
  `t ≤ gcd (card G) d`, the number of values with `ratioMult ≥ t` is exactly
  `card G / gcd(card G, d)`.

**Honest scope.**  This is the exact `STEP-2` algebraic input for the imprimitive sub-family that
the generic `RatioLevelSet.grs_line_incidence_le` over-estimates (`max deg = d` vs the true
`gcd(n,d)`), and it is the precise place where the ratio-census *re-encodes* the Gauss period:
`d = n/2` gives `gcd(n,d) = n/2`, the maximal collapse (`x^{n/2} = ±1` on `μ_n`).  It bounds the
**concentrated** part of the far-line incidence (the `μ_{n/gcd}`-coset of high-multiplicity scalars,
verified numerically as a `μ_{n/gcd}` coset of size `n/gcd`).  It is **NOT a closure**: the binding
far-line-to-*code* incidence is dominated by the *low*-multiplicity generic ratios (the Weil part),
which this law does not touch.  See the #407 D3 thread.

Char-free, no field-size hypothesis; pure finite cyclic-group theory built on Mathlib's
`IsCyclic.card_powMonoidHom_ker` / `card_powMonoidHom_range`.
