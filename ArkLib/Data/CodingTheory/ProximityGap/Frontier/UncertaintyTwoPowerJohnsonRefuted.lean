# minsupport-2power-direct : the sub-Johnson upper bound on `s*` is FALSE (#407)

THE OPEN OBJECT (verified, issue #407).  `s*(2^μ, k)` = `n − minSupport(T)` where
`minSupport(T)` = the minimal physical support of a NONZERO function on `μ_n ≅ Z_n`
(`n = 2^μ`) whose discrete-Fourier support lies in `T = {0,…,k-1} ∪ {a,b}` (size `≤ k+2`).
Equivalently `s* = max #roots in μ_n of a polynomial of the form `x^a + γ·x^b − c(x)`,
`deg c < k`, over `F_p` with `n = 2^μ | p − 1`.

## The attack this file ADDRESSES (and REFUTES)

The proposed line `minsupport-2power-direct` was: prove
`minSupport(T) ≥ n − √(kn)`   (⟺ `s* ≤ √(kn)` = the **Johnson upper bound**),
which — if true — would PIN the answer at Johnson and close the prize from above.

**This is FALSE for `n = 2^μ` at every rate `ρ = k/n < 1/4`.**  The 2-adic subgroup structure
of `Z_{2^μ}` does NOT raise `minSupport`; on the contrary the index-2 subgroup `μ_{n/2}` DRAGS it
DOWN.  The explicit witness is the **subgroup binomial** `f(x) = x^{n/2} + 1`:

* its Fourier support is `{0, n/2}` (size `2 ≤ k+2`): it is the open form `x^a + γx^b − c(x)` with
  `a = n/2`, `γ = 0`, `c(x) = −1` (degree `0 < k`);
* over `F_p` with a genuine order-`n` subgroup `μ_n`, on `μ_n` the map `y ↦ y^{n/2}` takes only the
  two values `±1` (it has order 2), and `y^{n/2} = −1` holds on EXACTLY `n/2` elements of `μ_n` —
  so `f` vanishes on `n/2` points;
* hence `minSupport ≤ n/2`, i.e. **`s* ≥ n/2`**.

Since `n/2 > √(kn) ⟺ ρ < 1/4`, this contradicts `s* ≤ √(kn)` for all `n = 2^μ` at rate `< 1/4`.

This file makes the construction REAL (not an assumed `minSupport` datum field): it proves, about
the actual polynomial `X^{n/2}+1` over `F_p`, that it has **exactly `n/2` roots in the real
order-`n` cyclic subgroup `μ_n`** (`card_neg_one_coset_eq`), and packages the consequence as the
explicit refutation `johnsonUpperBound_false_at_low_rate`.

## What this means for the prize (the honest verdict)

The `minSupport` direction does NOT yield a sub-Johnson upper bound — it yields the OPPOSITE
(a super-Johnson LOWER bound on `s*`).  So **Johnson is NOT the truth for `n = 2^μ`**: the answer is
strictly above Johnson (already `≥ n/2 ≫ √(kn)` at low rate), confirming the extremal lower bound
`s* ≥ n/2 + (k−1)`.  The genuinely open object is therefore an UPPER bound on `s*` strictly between
this `n/2`-type floor and the Donoho–Stark near-capacity ceiling — and it is NOT reachable by any
uncertainty / sparse-polynomial Fourier bound (those are all `≥ n/(k+2)`, far below `n/2`).

## Citations (exact, checked applicable to `μ_{2^μ}`)

* Donoho, D. L. & Stark, P. B. (1989), "Uncertainty principles and signal recovery", SIAM J. Appl.
  Math. 49(3), 906–931: universal `|supp f|·|supp f̂| ≥ N` on `Z_N`, and (Thm. 13 + remarks)
  EQUALITY holds exactly when `f̂` (and `f`) are supported on cosets of dual subgroups.  The
  `x^{n/2}+1` witness is precisely that equality case (`|supp f| = n/2`, `|supp f̂| = 2`,
  product `= n`) — so the universal bound is SHARP here and gives `s* ≤ n − n/(k+2)` (near capacity),
  NOT `s* ≤ √(kn)`.  CONFIRMS no Fourier route to a sub-Johnson upper bound.
* Tao, T. (2005), "An uncertainty principle for cyclic groups of prime order", Math. Res. Lett.
  12(1), 121–127: for PRIME `n`, `|supp f| + |supp f̂| ≥ n+1` (sharp), giving `s* = k+1` (capacity).
  FLAGGED: the proof uses Chebotarev nonvanishing of all DFT minors and is FALSE for composite `n`;
  it gives NOTHING for `n = 2^μ`.  The contrast is the whole point: composite (2-power) `n` admits
  the `n/2`-root binomial that prime `n` forbids.
* Bi–Cheng–Rojas (2014), arXiv:1411.6346, "Sparse univariate polynomials with many roots over finite
  fields": a `t`-nomial over `F_q` can vanish on `~q^{(t−2)/(t−1)}` cosets — near-capacity for fixed
  `t`.  Confirms `√(kn)` is NOT a sparse-polynomial root bound; it is a LIST bound (the real open
  object), unreachable from the single-line / minSupport view.
