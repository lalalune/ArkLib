# Trichotomy capstone: the three bucket-obstructions, assembled (#444)

The conjecture campaign (~150 conjectures; this session: 25 + 25 fresh-machine + 25 iterative-hardened + 22
bucket-evasion-targeted, **0 survivors**) is explained by a single meta-theorem
(`docs/kb/deltastar-444-conjecture-trichotomy-2026-06-17.md`): every conjecture proposed to bound the house
`M = max_{b≠0} |η_b|` (β = 4) falls into at least one of three buckets, and to *escape* it must simultaneously
satisfy E1 (output the `L^∞` sup, not a 2nd moment), E2 (a genuinely new object, not the Gauss-period / Cayley
spectrum / energy ladder renamed), and E3 (a hypothesis that holds on the flat, 0-dimensional, Sidon-except-negation,
zero-entropy `μ_n`). The constructive confirmation: 22 candidates *engineered* to evade all three buckets produced
**0 evaders**.

Each bucket's obstruction is landed axiom-clean in this cone; this file records the assembly and a combined corollary.

* **B1 (second-moment blind).** A bounded-depth moment functional pins the sup only up to `N^{1/2r}`:
  `_TrichotomyB1MomentBlind.moment_ambiguity` / `ambiguity_ratio_pow`, with `_AttackE2_MomentConeSpikeNoGo` (the
  `r=2` cone spike) and `_AttackAN2_TightFrameBTVacuous` (the period frame is exactly tight, so Bourgain–Tzafriri is
  vacuous). This file's `second_moment_does_not_decide_prize` is the `r=1` (Parseval) head of that family. Kills
  LP/Delsarte, SOS, Brascamp–Lieb, large-sieve, Nehari, isotropy/John-ellipsoid, Cheeger.
* **B2 (BGK-rename).** The object *is* the Cayley spectrum / energy: `_AttackR2_AbelianCayleyNonRamanujan`
  (`A χ_b = η_b χ_b`; abelian growing-degree Cayley is non-Ramanujan), `_AttackR6_RelationVarietyBezoutNoGo`
  (the relation variety counts `E_r`, not the excess), `_AttackT1_BiluLinialTwistNoGo`. Kills Weil-rep coeffs,
  transfer operators, Dudley chaining, motivic regulator, crystalline Newton-slopes, L-function/Chebotarev.
* **B3 (Sidon-0-dim hypothesis failure).** The machine needs structure `μ_n` lacks:
  `_AttackRT6_CyclicSchurMultiplierNoGo` (`H²(Z_n,ℂ*) = 0`, so a Drinfeld twist preserves the spectrum),
  `_AttackB1_BadSetCosetNonSidon` (the bad set is a coset union, the opposite of Sidon), `_DilationZeroEntropyNoGo`
  (the dilation is a single `n`-cycle, zero entropy). Kills decoupling/restriction (need curvature),
  Bourgain–Gamburd (`S·S = S`), Salem–Zygmund (need randomness), genus-reduction (genus 0), Katz rigidity,
  negative-association (fails for the periods).

**Combined corollary (this file, axiom-clean).** The cleanest unifying consequence of B1: the second moment
`S₂ = Σ_b |η_b|²` (the only degree-1 invariant, fixed at `pn − n²` by Parseval) does **not** decide the prize. Fix
the Parseval floor scale `a` (the `√n`-typical value) and a prize `target`. Whenever `target < √N · a` (always true
at the prize, where `√N = √(q−1) ≫ √log`), there is a spike spectrum with the **same** `S₂ = N·a²` whose maximum
`c = √N·a` **exceeds the target**, while the flat spectrum with that same `S₂` has maximum exactly `a`. So two
spectra share `S₂` yet straddle the target — no certificate reading only the second moment (the entire degree-1
core, and by `moment_ambiguity` the whole bounded-depth moment family) can prove `M ≤ C√(n log(q/n))`.

**Scope.** Not a proof the prize is false (`C ≈ 1.25` oscillates; the prize is believed true), nor that no proof
exists. It says: every route the campaign can generate reduces to B1 ∨ B2 ∨ B3 = the BGK/Paley wall, so winning
requires a genuine analytic-NT breakthrough on effective thin-subgroup Gauss-phase equidistribution at β = 4. Issue #444.

/-- **B1 combined corollary: the second moment does not decide the prize.** For `N ≥ 2` frequencies and the Parseval
floor scale `a > 0`, the spike `c = √N · a` has the **same** second moment as the flat spectrum (`N·a² = c²`) yet a
strictly larger maximum (`a < c`); and whenever the prize `target` satisfies `target < √N · a` (always true at the
prize, where `√N = √(q−1) ≫ √log`), the spike's maximum **exceeds** the target (`target < c`) while the flat
spectrum's maximum is exactly `a`. So two spectra share `S₂` yet straddle the target: a certificate reading only the
second moment cannot separate prize-satisfying from prize-violating spectra — `S₂` is blind to the sup. -/
