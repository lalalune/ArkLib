# SYZ40 — final assembly of the rate-`1/2` proximity strip theorem

## Research update (2026-09-04; not Lean formalized)

The unrestricted `UniformSylvesterInjective K (16*m) (8*m)` is refuted by the
smooth-domain construction in
`docs/kb/astra_grand_smooth_middle_counterexample-2026-09-04.md` for `m ≥ 4` and
fields containing `μ_{16m}`. The written proof and exact probes are independently
reviewed; there is no Lean counterexample theorem here. This includes production
dyadic order. The conditional theorems below remain valid, but the historical
description of this hypothesis as an open input must not be read as a viable
unrestricted route to closure. A replacement must retain genuine large-stack data.

This is the **closing document of the SYZ18–SYZ40 arc**.  Its single goal: express the whole
rate-`1/2` proximity strip theorem as **one theorem depending on exactly one named uniform
hypothesis**, `UniformSylvesterInjective`, with every input that resists a fully-formal discharge
folded **explicitly** into a single master hypothesis (no hidden assumptions).

## The four bounded deliverables

1. **General-`D` peel (fully proven, abstract linear algebra).**  `peel` / `peel_telescope` peel one
   core at a time via the SYZ34 fiber-product identity, expressing the `D`-core span dimension as the
   core dimensions minus the successive *punctured-pair* intersection dimensions
   `accum i ⊓ A i` — the exact objects the pair law (SYZ35) / Sylvester injectivity (SYZ38) control.
   `generation_of_stepwise_saturation` closes `D`-core generation once each incremental step meets
   its budget.  This is the honest general-`D` induction; nothing here is conditional.

2. **The named residual, uniformly quantified.**  `UniformSylvesterInjective K n k` is the honest
   `∀`-quantification of SYZ38's `SylvesterInjective` over *every* rate-`1/2` band degree profile — the
   sole open polynomial input, characterized arithmetically by SYZ39 (a per-config bounded-height
   resultant non-vanishing, uniform statement of BGK type).  `module_vanishes_of_uniform` discharges
   the entire in-budget syzygy module (all support strata) from it, per config.

3. **Wiring (poly ⇒ finrank).**  The bridge from SYZ38's *polynomial* module-vanishing to SYZ35's
   *subspace* generation equality is SYZ36's `d = syzdim` identity, which is **probe-verified but not
   formally proven**; it is folded as the explicit field `syzdimBridge` and consumed *through* the
   polynomial Sylvester injectivity supplied by (2), so `UniformSylvesterInjective` genuinely feeds
   the bridge.  Downstream, `pairInteriorLaw_iff_generation` (SYZ35) turns generation into the sharp
   punctured-pair law — SYZ33's lemma 2.

4. **Master hypothesis + final theorem.**  `StripMasterHypothesis` bundles, as a *single* `Prop`, the
   one named residual `uniformSylvester` together with the two inputs that resist formal discharge on
   the critical path — `syzdimBridge` (SYZ36 `d = syzdim`, probe-verified) and `realizability`
   (SYZ22 `SuperadditiveUnion`, the production ledger join) — each **named explicitly**.
   `strip_theorem_of_master_hypothesis` assembles the full two-branch strip conclusion;
   `strip_theorem_of_uniform_sylvester` records the part `UniformSylvesterInjective` controls *alone*
   (uniform polynomial module-vanishing), which is unconditional given the named hypothesis.  The
   lemma-1 fresh-independence supply is discharged separately (`lemma1_fresh_independence`, Part 1b)
   to two crisp band inputs and is *off* the assembled critical path.

## Honest status (unchanged verdict, now fully assembled)

The strip theorem is **conditional on exactly one substantive named statement**,
`UniformSylvesterInjective` — SYZ39's resultant non-vanishing, of BGK type at `n = 2³⁰`.  The two
other folded fields are genuine but structurally lighter (`syzdimBridge` is a probe-verified
identity; `realizability` is an MDS-shortening fact).  No unconditional `δ*` is delivered.  The
merged (`m ≤ 3`) branch of the strip is already unconditional (re-exported here as
`merged_branch_unconditional`); only the spread (`m ≥ 4`) branch consumes the hypothesis.

the SYZ34 fiber-product identity: the union dimension splits as `finrank C` plus the dimension of the
image of `W'` in the quotient `V ⧸ C`.  This is the atomic move of the general-`D` induction — no
band, coding, or genericity hypothesis is used.

`finrank (⨆_{i<D} A i) + Σ_{i<D} finrank (accum A i ⊓ A i) = Σ_{i<D} finrank (A i)`.

The `accum A i ⊓ A i` terms are *exactly* the objects SYZ35's pair law and SYZ38's Sylvester
injectivity control.  Pure linear algebra — no band or coding hypotheses. -/

dimensions and budgets are consistent with the ceiling `w`
(`Σ finrank (A i) = Σ b i + w`), then the `D` cores generate the ceiling
(`finrank (⨆_{i<D} A i) = w`).  The hypotheses `finrank (accum A i ⊓ A i) = b i` are precisely what a
per-step SYZ38 Sylvester-injectivity instance supplies (via the pair law); this closes the
general-`D` induction conditionally on those per-step inputs. -/

`W_AB, W_AC, W_BC` over `K[X]` whose degrees realise a strict-interior band incidence
(`natDegree W_XY = m_XY − t`) at rate `1/2` (`n = 2k`) in the Koszul-out regime
(`k − 1 < m_AB + m_AC − t`, SYZ37), the generalized Sylvester map is injective on the in-budget
cofactor window (budgets `k − 1 − m_AC`, `k − 1 − m_BC`).

This was the proposed single substantive input of the strip theorem. The research update
above refutes the unrestricted quantification as written, even with disjoint smooth-domain
root sets. SYZ39's per-configuration arithmetic characterization and the conditional
consequences below remain valid; a genuine-stack restriction is still needed. -/

genericity lemma 2 needs).  Granting these, a fresh functional choice `f i ∈ Blk i` exists with
`E.mkQ (f i)` linearly independent.  This is the honest lemma-1 discharge; it is **not** on the

named residual with the three inputs that resist a fully-formal discharge — every one named
explicitly, so there are **no hidden assumptions**.

* `uniformSylvester` — **the** substantive open input (Part 2 / SYZ38 / SYZ39).
* `syzdimBridge` — SYZ36's `d = syzdim` identity in the "vanishing ⇒ generation" direction, folded:
  a rate-`1/2` band subspace triple `(A,B,C)` whose reduced polynomial data
  `(W_AB, W_AC, W_BC, b_AC, b_BC)` is Sylvester-injective (supplied by `uniformSylvester`) generates
  its ceiling `W`.  Probe-verified (0 mismatches, SYZ36), not formally proven, hence folded — but
  consumed *through* the polynomial injectivity, so the named residual genuinely feeds it.
* `realizability` — the SYZ22 `SuperadditiveUnion` production-ledger join for the spread stack; the
  MDS-shortening dimension count `2(|U|−k)` that closes the union budget.

/-- **THE final theorem — the rate-`1/2` strip, assembled on one named hypothesis.**  Given the
master hypothesis (whose only substantive open field is `uniformSylvester`), the full rate-`1/2`
strip conclusion holds in both branches:

* **merged branch** (`m ≤ 3`, unconditional): every block-attributed bad set has `#B ≤ n − 1`;
* **spread branch** (`m ≥ 4`, via the hypothesis): the sharp punctured-pair law (SYZ33 lemma 2) holds
  for every rate-`1/2` band triple, and the union budget `|U| ≤ n − 1` holds for every spread stack.

Thus every over-budget rate-`1/2` stack is within budget — the strip conclusion — conditional on the
single named `UniformSylvesterInjective` (plus the explicitly-folded bridge / realizability).

The **merged branch** (`m ≤ 3`) is unconditional and is the separate theorem
`merged_branch_unconditional` (it consumes no hypothesis); the two conjuncts below are the
**spread branch** (`m ≥ 4`), which is exactly where the master hypothesis is consumed:

* the sharp punctured-pair law (SYZ33 lemma 2) for every rate-`1/2` band triple, and
