# The deployed census-weld budget is INFEASIBLE at the deep central band (#444)

The census-domination weld (`CensusDominationWeld.lean`) pins the deployed
`δ* = 1 − r/2^μ` GRANTING two things:

* the named Prop **`CensusDomination dom k a₀ K`** — every stack has at most `K` alignable
  `a`-sets at every band `a ≥ a₀` (`CensusDominationWeld.CensusDomination`); and
* the deployed budget **`K / p ≤ ε*`**, i.e. `K ≤ ε*·p` (the `hK` hypothesis of
  `kkh26_deltaStar_pin_of_censusDomination`).

The necessity companion `CensusCapForcedBelow.censusDomination_cap_ge_choose` forces, from a
SINGLE `γ`-aligned set `A` with a non-degenerate `(k+1)`-tuple, the lower bracket

  `C(|A| − (k+1), a − (k+1)) ≤ K`   at every band `a ∈ [k+1, |A|]`.

and `KKH26AlignmentSupply.kkh26_fibreUnion_aligned_nondegenerate` REALIZES such a set: for
the KKH26 line at code dimension `k = (r−2)m+1` on the smooth `n = s·m` domain, every
`r`-subset of the `m`-power subgroup yields a `γ`-aligned set `A` of size exactly `r·m`
carrying a non-degenerate `(k+1)`-tuple.

**What is new here.**  This file WELDS the necessity floor against the supply realizer and
then against the deployed `K`-budget, at the DEEP CENTRAL band.  With `|A| = r·m` and
`k+1 = (r−2)m+2`, the residual window has width `|A| − (k+1) = 2m − 2`; choosing the
central band `a = (r−1)m + 1` gives `a − (k+1) = m − 1`, so the necessity floor is exactly
the **central binomial coefficient**

  `C(2m − 2, m − 1) = centralBinom (m − 1)`,

which is `≥ 4^{m−1}/(2(m−1))` — EXPONENTIAL in the multiplicity `m`.  Hence:

* `census_cap_ge_centralBinom` (the welded floor): for the KKH26 supply at any `r`-subset
  `T`, every `K` witnessing the per-stack census bound at the central band must dominate
  `centralBinom (m − 1)`;
* `not_censusDomination_of_budget_lt_centralBinom` (the infeasibility): if the deployed
  budget `K` is below `centralBinom (m − 1)`, the named Prop `CensusDomination` at the
  central band is FALSE for the KKH26 stack — so the weld's two hypotheses are jointly
  UNSATISFIABLE there.

**Honest scope.**  This is NOT a CORE closure and NOT a refutation of the prize.  It is a
precise constraint-lemma on the DEPLOYED census weld: the named `CensusDomination` Prop, at
the deep central band, requires a budget `K ≥ centralBinom (m−1) = 2^{Θ(m)}`, which is
EXPONENTIAL in the multiplicity, whereas the prize calibration `ε*·q ≈ n` makes `K ≤ ε*·p`
only POLYNOMIAL.  So the census normal form **cannot be invoked at the deep central band**
in the high-multiplicity slice `centralBinom (m−1) > K` — it must live at the Johnson-scale
agreement radius `a ≈ √(kn) ≫ (r−1)m+1`, exactly the honest reading recorded in
`Frontier/CountLaneNotSecondOrder.lean` and `DeepBandSupplyExponential.lean` (where the
SIBLING `ExplainableCoreSupply` object was shown exponential at the deep band).  This is the
matching result for the DISTINCT `alignableSets`/`CensusDomination` object the weld actually
uses, carried all the way to the weld's deployed `K`-budget — which neither sibling file
does.  It makes no capacity / beyond-Johnson / growth-law claim (ASYMPTOTIC GUARD untouched).
The central binomial is exponential ⟹ the deep band is the WRONG radius, NOT that the prize
is impossible.  Probe: `scripts/probes/probe_census_cap_exceeds_budget.py` (the threshold is
sharp — feasible for `m = 2`, infeasible from `m ≥ ~½ log₂ n`).

Axiom-clean (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`); no `sorry`.
