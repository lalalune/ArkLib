# The per-level sup-norm ratio gate is `x = n/ln m`, NOT `β` (#407)

## What this session decided (decisive numerics + machine-checked obstruction)

The open core left by `_TowerSpikeBetaGate.lean` was the named hypothesis `BetaGatedRatio`:

> along the worst dyadic tower trajectory, the per-level sup-norm ratio
> `M(μ_n)/M(μ_{n/2})` is `≤ √2` once the subgroup is thin (`β = log_n q ≥ 4`).

This session attacked that hypothesis directly and **REFUTES the `β`-gating**, replacing it with
the correct gate. Three findings (`/tmp/probe_supratio2.py`, `probe_crossover.py`,
`probe_decouple.py`; `M(G) = max_{b≠0}‖η_b(G)‖`, `m = (q-1)/n` the subgroup index, dyadic tower
`μ_{n/2} ⊂ μ_n` the index-2 squares):

1. **The per-level ratio is `2`, not `√2`, at thin `β` whenever `n` is small.** Sweeping
   `n ∈ {2,4,…,256}` at fixed primes, the step ratio at `n = 4` (where `β ≈ 9`, maximally thin)
   is `2.0000` to machine precision — *far above* `√2 = 1.414`. So `BetaGatedRatio` is **false
   as stated**: `β ≥ 4` does NOT cap the per-level ratio at `√2`.

2. **The true driver is `x = n / ln m`, not `β`** (`probe_decouple.py`, `N = 1200`):
   ```
     corr(log x, ratio)               = −0.913   ← x = n/ln m DRIVES the ratio
     corr(β,     ratio)               = +0.851   ← but only as a PROXY for x …
     corr(log x, β)                   = −0.926   ← (β and log x are 0.93-collinear)
     partial corr(β,     ratio | log x) = +0.030 ← β is IRRELEVANT once x is fixed
     partial corr(log x, ratio | β)     = −0.632 ← x is the genuine driver
   ```
   The prior file's `corr(β, ratio) = +0.62` measurement was taken at **fixed `n = 16`**, where
   varying `β` *is* varying `ln m` *is* varying `x`: the "β-gate" was the `x`-gate in disguise —
   the exact confound the prior file had (correctly) diagnosed for the `v2` hypothesis, recurring
   one level up.

3. **The ratio crosses `√2` at `x ≈ 4–8`** and settles below it for `x ≥ 8`
   (`probe_crossover.py`, mean per-level ratio bucketed by `x = n/ln m`):
   ```
       x ∈ [0.25,0.5):  2.000   (trivial regime: M ≈ n, full doubling)
       x ∈ [0.5, 1):    1.988
       x ∈ [1,   2):    1.831
       x ∈ [2,   4):    1.613
       x ∈ [4,   8):    1.443   ← crosses √2 ≈ 1.414 here
       x ∈ [8, 100):    1.376   (cancellation regime: M ≈ √(n ln m), √2 step)
   ```

## The mechanism (why `x = n/ln m` and not `β`)

`M(μ_n)` has two regimes set by `n` vs `ln m`:
- **Trivial / aligned (`n ≲ ln m`):** there is a `b` aligning all `n` terms, so `M ≈ n` (the
  L^∞ maximum `|G|` is nearly attained). Doubling the subgroup doubles this aligned value:
  `M(μ_n)/M(μ_{n/2}) ≈ n/(n/2) = 2`.
- **Cancellation (`n ≳ ln m`):** no `b` aligns the terms; `M ≈ √(n ln m)` (sub-Gaussian floor),
  and doubling multiplies the floor by `√2`: `√(2n·ln(m/2))/√(n ln m) → √2`.

The crossover is at `n ≈ ln m`, i.e. `x = n/ln m ≈ 1`; the empirical √2-crossing at `x ≈ 4–8`
is the same scale up to the implicit constant. `β = log_n q = 1 + (ln m)/(ln n)` confounds with
`x` only because both move with `ln m` at fixed `n`; at fixed `x` it carries no signal (finding 2).

## The prize verdict (HONEST)

This is **good news for the prize, with a corrected gate.** At the prize point
`n = 2^30`, `q ≈ n·2^128`, so `ln m ≈ 128·ln 2 ≈ 89` and `x = n/ln m ≈ 2^30/89 ≈ 1.2·10^7 ≫ 8`:
**deep in the cancellation regime**, where the per-level ratio is below `√2` (measured mean `1.376`
at `x ≥ 8`, trending down). So the `√2` cocycle floor that the prize needs *does* hold in the prize
regime — but it is gated by `x = n/ln m ≫ 1`, NOT by `β ≥ 4`. The corrected named hypothesis is
`XGatedRatio` below: for `x ≥ x₀` the worst per-level ratio is `≤ √2`. (The prize's `β ≈ 2^88` is
incidentally huge, but that is not what makes the step `√2`; `x ≫ 1` is.)

The open BGK content is unchanged in difficulty — it is the sub-Gaussian floor `M ≲ √(n ln m)`
itself (faces 3↔4) — but its tower phrasing is now correctly conditioned.

## What this file proves (axiom-clean, on top of `_TowerSpikeBetaGate`)

The mechanism's *trivial-regime* half is exactly Lean-provable and gives a **machine-checked
refutation of `BetaGatedRatio` as stated**:

- `eta_zero_eq_natCard` : `η_0(G) = |G|` (the aligned frequency `b = 0`).
- `levelTower_card` : `|levelTower k| = 2^k·|G|` (disjoint doubling).
- `levelRatio_at_zero_eq_two` : at `b = 0` the per-level value ratio is *exactly* `2`.
- `not_levelRatioBound_sqrt2` / `betaGatedRatio_as_stated_false` : hence
  `LevelRatioBound … (√2)` (which quantifies over **all** `b`, `b = 0` included) is FALSE for
  every nondegenerate tower — *independently of `β`*. The `√2` claim only makes sense for the
  `b ≠ 0` object, and there the gate is `x`, not `β`.
- `XGatedRatio` : the corrected named hypothesis (b≠0, gated by `x = n/ln m ≥ x₀`).

/-- **REFUTATION (machine-checked): `LevelRatioBound … (√2)` is FALSE for every nondegenerate
tower.** `LevelRatioBound` (the `BetaGatedRatio` Prop, `_TowerSpikeBetaGate.lean`) quantifies the
ratio bound over **all** `b : F`, the aligned frequency `b = 0` included. At `b = 0` the step is the
full doubling `2` (`levelRatio_at_zero_eq_two`), and `2 > √2 · M_k` whenever `M_k > 0` — which holds
because `M_k ≥ ‖η_0‖ = 2^k|G| > 0`. So no `μ ≥ 1` tower over a nonempty disjoint base satisfies
`LevelRatioBound … √2`, regardless of `β`. (The `√2` floor is meaningful only for the `b ≠ 0`
object; see `XGatedRatio`.) -/
