# Agreement-set PACKING: distinct pinned scalars share only DEGENERATE overlap (issue #444,
under-det face)

`CensusScalarPartition` proved the census decomposition `#alignableSets = Σ_γ
#alignedSetsForScalar γ`
and the SET-level uniqueness `alignedSetsForScalar_disjoint` (`Aligned.gamma_eq`: a non-degenerate
aligned `a`-set has a UNIQUE pinned scalar).  The OPEN object is a bound on the distinct-`γ` count
`#pinnedScalars` itself (`BadScalarsEqPinned`: `#bad = #pinnedScalars`; the deployed `δ*` budget).

This file supplies the structural PACKING lever the distinct-`γ` count needs — the
**agreement-set overlap law**, in the under-determined / agreement-sharing face:

> **Two non-degenerately aligned sets with DISTINCT scalars overlap only DEGENERATELY.**
> If `S` is non-degenerately `γ`-aligned and `S'` is non-degenerately `γ'`-aligned with `γ ≠ γ'`,
> then EVERY injective `(k+1)`-tuple inside `S ∩ S'` is degenerate (`residual u₀ = residual u₁ =
0`).

The mechanism is `Aligned.gamma_eq` lifted to the intersection: a non-degenerate `(k+1)`-tuple in
`S ∩ S'` would be both `γ`- and `γ'`-aligned, forcing `γ = γ'`.  So the *only* way two distinct
pinned scalars can share a `(k+1)`-subset is through a JOINTLY deg-`<k` (degenerate /
`pairJointAgreesOn`) core — exactly the structure the census EXCLUDES by its non-degeneracy clause.

## Why this is the under-det / sharing face (not the monomial proxy)

The monomial / over-determined proxy counts the incidence `#alignableSets` and was shown
(growth-law resolution, #444) to collapse to Johnson via the SAT-then-cliff staircase at `s ≈ n/2`.
The TRUE `δ*` is governed by the distinct-`γ` count `#pinnedScalars`, which the proxy over-counts by
the multiplicity excess `Σ(mult γ − 1)`.  This file isolates the agreement-SHARING contribution to
that gap: distinct pinned scalars can only share a DEGENERATE (jointly-deg`<k`) core.  Consequently
the per-scalar agreement-set "non-degenerate cores" pack — distinct scalars' aligned sets cannot
share a non-degenerate `(k+1)`-tuple.  Probe `probe_underdet_agreementset_packing.py` (exact `F_p`,
PROPER `μ_n`, `p ≫ n³`, never `n=q−1`, binding band `a = n/2`): for every structured/random stack
the
max pairwise overlap of distinct pinned scalars' agreement sets is `≤ k`, and at `a = n/2` the
distinct-`γ` count collapses (`#pinned = 1` at `n = 12, 16`) — the sharing does NOT sustain a
window-interior gap; any beyond-Johnson gap must live in the per-`γ` char-sum (BGK) wall.

## Scope (rules 3, 6 — honesty contract)

This is NOT a CORE closure and NOT thinness-essential: it is field-universal combinatorics about the
alignment census, sharpening the under-det / agreement-sharing face.  It pins the agreement-set
overlap structure exactly (degenerate-only sharing), the packing prerequisite for bounding the
distinct-`γ` count.  It does NOT yet bound `#pinnedScalars` (that needs the degenerate-core size
cap,
the open BGK-adjacent brick).  CORE (`M(μ_n) ≤ C·√(n·log(p/n))`) stays OPEN.
