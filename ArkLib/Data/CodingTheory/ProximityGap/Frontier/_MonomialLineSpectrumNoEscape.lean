# Surface 2: the restricted-large-values route over monomial frequencies does not escape (#407)

This scratch lane records the honest verdict of the **Surface 2** investigation: the prize does
NOT need the *global* character-sum sup-norm `B = max_{b≠0} |η_b|`; it only needs the *worst-line
incidence* `I(δ) = #{bad scalars γ}` over the structured family of monomial lines.  The hope was
that restricting the moment / large-values count to the `n²` monomial-line frequencies (rather
than all `p` frequencies) escapes the moment no-go (`_MomentMethodNoGo.lean`, which only forbids
certifying the *global* sup `< n`).

**The measured verdict (probes `/tmp/s2/probe_s2_*.py`, exact, `n ∈ {8,16}`, `ρ ∈ {1/2,1/4}`):**

* For the worst MONOMIAL line `u₀ = X^i, u₁ = X^j` (`i,j ≥ k`), the `mcaEvent` bad-scalar count
  (ABF26 Def 4.3, *with* the joint-agreement exclusion) at the prize-window agreement `w = k+1`
  (i.e. `δ = 1 − ρ − 1/n`, just above capacity) is **exactly `q-INDEPENDENT`** (`= 40` for `n=8`,
  `9584` for the worst `n=16` direction `(9,12)`), identical across every prime `q = n^β`,
  `β ∈ {3.5,…,4.0}`.
* The agreement PLATEAUS at exactly `w = k+1`: the bad count drops to `0` at `w = k+2`
  (`δ = 1 − ρ − 2/n`) — a sharp cliff (also for non-monomial high-span directions at `n=8,16`).
* The per-codeword incidence is `O(1)` (the in-tree line-ball brick,
  `LineBallSingleCodewordEnvelope.lean`); the bad count is `(#codewords in the list) × O(1)`,
  and `#codewords = #flat (k+1)-windows = C(n,k+1) ~ 2^{H(ρ)·n}` — the LIST SIZE above Johnson.

**So Surface 2 RE-COLLAPSES, not escapes:** the worst-monomial incidence is a *characteristic-zero
combinatorial* quantity (the above-Johnson list size `C(n,k+1)`), which the character-sum / large-
values machinery never sees.  The moment no-go is about the *global, `q`-dependent* sup-norm at
the sub-`n` BGK scale — a genuinely different object that is irrelevant to this incidence.  The
per-codeword O(1) escape is real, but summed over the exponential list it re-collapses to the
list-decoding count above Johnson (the project's open face 4 / B4 LD⇒MCA).

This file formalizes only the *structural* facts that make the count `q`-independent:

* `badScalars_card_le_windows` — the bad-scalar set is the SUPPORT (distinct-value image) of a
  finite collision family indexed by the `(k+1)`-windows, hence `≤ C(n,k+1)`, with NO field
  dependence (the character-sum sup-norm `B` never appears).
* `windows_le_support_mul_maxFibre` — the *no-escape mechanism*: shrinking the support below a
  target forces a large window-fibre, i.e. a scalar shared by many windows = high agreement =
  below Johnson.  So the support cannot be made small (`≤ n`) without leaving the prize window.

No theorem here claims the prize is solved; the equality with the saturated profile and the
worst-over-ALL-lines (non-monomial / complete-homogeneous, `_CompleteHomogeneousReadout.lean`)
question remain the open core.

/-- **The Surface-2 structural bound: the bad-scalar count is at most the number of windows,
with NO dependence on the field / character-sum sup-norm.**  The bad-scalar count of a monomial
line is the support size of the window-collision family, hence `≤ #windows = C(n,k+1)`.  This is
the field-independent (characteristic-zero, list-size) wall — the global character-sum sup-norm
`B` never enters this count. -/

/-- **No-escape mechanism (support–collision tension).**  The number of live windows is at most
the support size times the largest window-fibre.  Equivalently: to push the bad-scalar count
(the support) below a target, the live windows must collide heavily (a large fibre), i.e. one
scalar is shared by many `(k+1)`-windows — which is exactly a high-agreement event (below the
Johnson radius).  So one cannot have *both* a small support (`≤ n`) *and* a large window count
(`C(n,k+1)`) without a large fibre; in the prize window the fibre is bounded, so the support
stays large.  This is the structured analogue of the moment no-go. -/

/-- **Corollary (the wall, contrapositive form).**  If every window-fibre is small (`≤ m`, the
prize-window agreement cap) and there are many live windows (`≥ N`, the list size `C(n,k+1)`),
then the bad-scalar count is at least `N / m` — super-linear in `n` whenever `N = 2^{Θ(n)}` and
`m` is polynomial.  No field-size / character-sum input is used. -/
