# LEVER K: the dilation-pencil shared-root count IS the multiplicative autocorrelation (#407)

This file isolates and formalizes the **clean, field-free reformulation** of the Kelley–Owen
dilation-pencil shared-root count that controls Kelley Conjecture 3.2 (the sub-Johnson
general-position bound = explicit-RS curve decodability).

## The setup (LEVER K)

Let `P` be the prize agreement polynomial `P = Xᵃ + γ·Xᵇ − c(X)` (`deg c < k`, support of size
`t = k+2`), and let `S = {x ∈ μ_n : P(x) = 0}` be its root set inside the order-`n` multiplicative
subgroup, `r = |S|`. The Kelley–Owen / Stepanov *dilation pencil* dilates `P` by every root:
`gᵢ(x) := P(ζᵢ·x)` for `ζᵢ ∈ S`. The root set of `gᵢ` inside `μ_n` is

  `Bᵢ = {w ∈ μ_n : P(ζᵢ·w) = 0} = ζᵢ⁻¹·S`,

so each `Bᵢ` has `|Bᵢ| = r` and contains `1` (because `ζᵢ ∈ S`). The Kelley–Owen double-count
bounds `r` by how much the `Bᵢ` overlap pairwise. The whole question is the **pairwise overlap**.

## The reformulation proven here (the new bridge)

**`inter_dilate_eq_autocorr`** : the pairwise pencil overlap is *exactly* a multiplicative
autocorrelation of the root set itself —

  `|Bᵢ ∩ Bⱼ| = |ζᵢ⁻¹·S ∩ ζⱼ⁻¹·S| = |S ∩ (ζᵢ·ζⱼ⁻¹)·S|`.

So the entire Kelley–Owen pencil shared-root count is the **multiplicative autocorrelation**
`M(S) := max_{ρ ≠ 1} |S ∩ ρ·S|` of `S`. This is field-free (it never mentions `P`, `γ`, the
codeword, or the characteristic), so it cleanly *separates* the algebraic input (S is a sparse
root set) from the combinatorial extraction. It is the right object for Kelley 3.2.

## The Fisher/packing extraction (`pencil_root_bound`)

With the punctured blocks `Cᵢ = Bᵢ \ {1}` (size `r−1`, pairwise overlap `≤ M − 1`), a Corrádi /
Fisher inequality gives the root bound. We land the clean two-extreme cases:
* `M = 1` (trinomial / `t=3` face) ⟹ punctured blocks disjoint ⟹ `r(r−1)+1 ≤ n`, i.e. `r ≤ ½+√n`
  (this recovers `KelleyOwenDilationPencil.pencil_card_core`, here re-derived from the
  autocorrelation viewpoint), and
* general `M` ⟹ the double-count `r·(r−1) ≤ (M−1)·(something)+…` only reaches Johnson.

## The precise obstruction, machine-checked (`autocorr_saturated_by_coset`)

The honest negative result that pins LEVER K: the autocorrelation `M(S)` is **saturated by the
coset core of `S`, not by the isolated excess**. Concretely, if `S ⊇ H` for a subgroup
`H = μ_d ⊆ μ_n` of order `d`, then taking any `ρ ∈ H \ {1}` gives `H ⊆ S ∩ ρ·S`, so
`M(S) ≥ d − 1` *(it is at least the whole coset core)*. For the prize-relevant worst case
`S = (coset of size n/2) ∪ {straggler}` (the `_RThinSqrtNKRefuted` family), this forces
`M(S) ≥ n/2 − 1`, and the Fisher bound then yields only `r ≤ Θ(n)` = Johnson, NOT sub-Johnson.

So: the multiplicative-autocorrelation reformulation is **exact and char-free**, but the worst-case
autocorrelation is dominated by the legitimate coset core (the actual list-decoding output), exactly
as `_RThinSqrtNKRefuted` shows for the raw size. Kelley 3.2 / sub-Johnson would require bounding the
autocorrelation of the **ragged excess after coset-core removal** — the double-count over the full
`S` provably cannot reach it. This is the precise obstruction, distinct from any char-`p` Wronskian
gap (the Wronskian route closes the `t=3`/distinct-degree case unconditionally; it is *this*
coset-saturation that blocks the general `t = k+2` pencil).

Axiom-clean (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`); no `sorry`.

/-! ## The precise obstruction: autocorrelation is saturated by the coset core

The negative half of LEVER K, machine-checked. If `S` contains an order-`d` subgroup `H = μ_d`
(its coset core), then for any `ρ ∈ H, ρ ≠ 1` the *whole* core lies in the overlap, so
`M(S) ≥ d − 1`. For the prize worst case `d = n/2`, this forces `M(S) ≥ n/2 − 1`, and the
Fisher/double-count then gives only Johnson — never sub-Johnson. The autocorrelation route is
dominated by the legitimate coset core, exactly as the raw-size bound is (`_RThinSqrtNKRefuted`). -/

/-- A finite subgroup `H ⊆ G` (as a `Finset`, closed under `*` and containing the dilation `ρ ∈ H`)
is fixed by left-dilation by any of its own elements: `ρ ∈ H ⟹ H ⊆ dilate ρ H`. -/

  exact hmul ρ⁻¹ (hinv ρ hρ) x hx

/-- **THE OBSTRUCTION (machine-checked).** If the root set `S` contains a multiplicative subgroup
`H` (its coset core) and `ρ ∈ H`, then the autocorrelation of `S` at `ρ` is at least `|H|`:
the entire coset core sits inside the overlap. Hence for `ρ ≠ 1` in `H`,

  `|S ∩ ρ·S| ≥ |H|`,

so the pencil overlap (= autocorrelation) is dominated by the coset core, NOT by the isolated
ragged excess. With `|H| = n/2` (the prize worst case) this is `≥ n/2`, blocking sub-Johnson. -/

/-- **Consequence: the autocorrelation obstruction is genuine.** If `S` contains a subgroup `H`
of order `≥ 2` (a nontrivial coset core), then there is a *nontrivial* shift `ρ ≠ 1` with
`|S ∩ ρ·S| ≥ |H|`. So `M(S) := max_{ρ≠1} |S ∩ ρS| ≥ |H|`: any autocorrelation upper bound used
in a Kelley-3.2 argument must be `≥` the largest coset core of `S`. The double-count over the
full `S` therefore cannot beat the coset core (= the legitimate list output). -/

/-! ## The positive `t = 3` extreme: `M = 1` recovers the trinomial √n bound

When the autocorrelation is `1` (the trinomial / `t=3` primitive face: distinct pencil members
share *only* the point `1`), the punctured blocks are pairwise disjoint and the Kelley–Owen
count `r(r−1)+1 ≤ n` follows. This connects the autocorrelation viewpoint to the in-tree
`KelleyOwenDilationPencil.pencil_card_core`. -/

/-- **`M = 1` ⟹ punctured pencil blocks pairwise disjoint.** If the autocorrelation of `S` is
`≤ 1` at every nontrivial shift, then for distinct roots `ζᵢ ≠ ζⱼ` the punctured blocks
`Bᵢ \ {1}`, `Bⱼ \ {1}` are disjoint (their only common point was `1`). This is the disjointness
hypothesis of `pencil_card_core`, derived from the autocorrelation bound. -/
