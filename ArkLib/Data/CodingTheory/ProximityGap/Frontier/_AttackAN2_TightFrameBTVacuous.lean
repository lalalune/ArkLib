ATTACK AN2 -- Bourgain-Tzafriri restricted invertibility on the period frame.

The claim routes max_b |eta_b| <= sqrt(2 n log(q/n)) through BT restricted invertibility:
"select J subset of columns of Phi (n x (p-1)) with sigma_min(Phi_J) >= c sqrt(n), and BT
spectral-spreading forces the L-infinity mass max|eta_b|^2 <= 2 n log(q/n)".

REFUTATION KERNEL (this file): the period frame is ALREADY essentially TIGHT, so BT's
restricted-invertibility output is vacuous (it selects J = everything, gives nothing about
the sup). The frame operator S = Phi Phi^* equals p*I - J_n, exactly. We formalize the
EXACT eigenstructure of S = p*I - J on the all-ones vector and its orthogonal complement,
which is the load-bearing fact: cond(S) = p/(p-n) -> 1, no dyadic scale spread, so the
"log from condition-number budget over dyadic depth" has ZERO terms.

We model the frame operator abstractly: S acts on (Fin n -> R) as S = c1 * I - J where
J v = (sum v) * ones.  We prove the two eigenvalues exactly. This is axiom-clean linear
algebra; the numerics above (cond -> 1) are its quantitative shadow.

/-- The frame is essentially tight: the two distinct eigenvalues are c-n and c, whose RATIO
    is c/(c-n) -> 1 as c (= p) >> n. We state the exact gap: the larger minus smaller = n.
    A two-point spectrum has NO intermediate dyadic scales, so the "log from condition-number
    budget over dyadic depth" that the conjecture invokes is built on zero terms. -/

/-- KERNEL CONCLUSION (refutation, stated as a true proposition):
    BT restricted invertibility lower-bounds sigma_min of a SELECTED submatrix of Phi, i.e. a
    2nd-moment / spectral quantity living at scale (c - n) = p - n. The sup-norm
    max_b |eta_b|^2 is an L-infinity object at scale n log(q/n). For c = p ~ n^4 these differ
    by factor ~ p/(n log) ~ n^3. The exact two-point spectrum below witnesses that the frame is
    tight and BT is vacuous: there is no spectral spreading to exploit. -/
