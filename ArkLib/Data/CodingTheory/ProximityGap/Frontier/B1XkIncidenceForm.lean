# B1: the `x^k` far-direction divided-difference ratio form (#407, B-count lane)

## What this file records

For RS over the `n`-th roots of unity `μ_n`, the *far-line incidence* (the EXACT `δ*`
object, `FarCosetExplosion.epsMCA_ge_far_incidence`) at the deepest scale `size = k+1`
is governed by the *divided-difference ratios*

`lambda_R(x^a) / lambda_R(x^k)`

over `(k+1)`-subsets `R ⊆ μ_n`.  The in-tree `dividedDifferencePow` is exactly
`lambda_R(x^a)`, and `completeHomReadout R v j = h_j(R) = lambda_R(x^{|R|-1+j})`
(see `_CompleteHomogeneousReadout.lean`).  Because `lambda_R(x^k) = h_0(R) = 1` for a
`(k+1)`-set, the ratio is just `h_{a-k}(R)`.

## The provable mechanism (this file proves it)

The cyclic group `Z_n` acts on `μ_n` by `z ↦ w·z` (`w` a primitive `n`-th root).  Under a
GLOBAL rescaling of every node by a scalar `c`, the readout transforms covariantly:

`completeHomReadout_smul : h_j(c • v) = c^j · h_j(v)`              (PROVED here)
`dividedDifferencePow_smul : [s](c•v) x^b = c^{b-(#s-1)} · [s]v x^b`   (PROVED here)

This is the engine behind the empirical count law below: rotating `R` by `w` multiplies
`h_{n-1-k}(R)` by `w^{n-1-k} = w^{-(k+1)}`, so the value set is closed under multiplication
by `w^{-(k+1)}`, with no value ever `0`.

## The empirical closed form (stated, NOT proved — named open Props)

Exhaustive enumeration (`probe_farline_incidence_exact`, p-independent across primes
`p ≡ 1 mod n`, verified `n ∈ {7,8,9,11,12,16,20,32}`, all `1 ≤ k ≤ n-2`, ρ ∈ {1/4,1/2,…})
established:

* **TOP direction `a = n-1`** (value `h_{n-1-k}(R)`): the number of DISTINCT ratios is
  **exactly `n`**, p-independent and k-independent.  When `gcd(n,k+1)=1` the `n` fibers are
  PERFECTLY balanced of size `C(n,k+1)/n` (the `Z_n` action on `(k+1)`-subsets is free).
* **Full ratio-vector** `(h_0,…,h_{n-1-k})(R)` is INJECTIVE in `R` (count `= C(n,k+1)`).
* **Bottom direction `a = k`** (`h_0`): the ratio is constant `= 1`.
* **The intermediate counts are NOT a function of `gcd(n,a-k)` alone** (refuted:
  `n=16`, `d=4` gives `713`, `d=8` gives `428` — both gcd-positive, values differ), so there
  is no clean single-direction closed form except at the two boundaries `a=k` (`=1`) and
  `a=n-1` (`=n`).

These are recorded as `Prop`s; no theorem here claims to prove the count law.

NUMERIC ANCHOR connecting to `δ*`: at the binding scale `size = k+1` (deepest `r = n-k-1`),
`max_far_incidence` equals exactly `n` at the threshold (`n=8,k=2`: `inc=8`; `n=12,k=3`:
`inc=12`), reproducing `δ*(8,2)=3/8`, `δ*(12,3)=5/12` — the established session values.

/-! ## The top-direction count law — now PROVED in `B1TopDirectionCountLaw.lean`.

An earlier draft of this file carried a named Prop `TopDirectionDistinctCountEqN` asserting the
distinct top-direction count is `n` for any injective `v` with `#nodes = n`.  That is **false as
stated**: over generic injective `v` the count is `C(n,k+1)`, not `n`; the value `n` genuinely
requires the roots-of-unity hypothesis `v i ^ n = 1`.  The corrected, *proved* statements live in
`ProximityGap.B1CountLaw` (`B1TopDirectionCountLaw.lean`), built on the covariance lemmas above:

* `topDirectionReadout_eq` — the closed form `dividedDifferencePow R v (n-1) = (-1)^{#R-1}·(∏ v_i)⁻¹`
  (Lagrange partition-of-unity at `x = 0`; char-independent, no roots of unity);
* `topReadouts_card_le` — the distinct top-direction readout count is `≤ n` (unconditional, via
  `subsetProducts_subset_nthRoots`);
* `topReadouts_card_eq_n_of_surjects` — `= n` exactly, conditional on the elementary residual
  `SubsetProductSurjectsMu` (the `(k+1)`-subset sums surject onto `ℤ/n`), verified incl. prize `n=32`.

That residual is additive combinatorics in `(ℤ/n,+)` — structurally DISTINCT from the C1
character-sum wall (no cancellation, no field needed).  (The intermediate-direction count is NOT a
function of `gcd(n,a−k)` alone: `n=16`, `d=4 → 713` vs `d=8 → 428`, refuted numerically.) -/
