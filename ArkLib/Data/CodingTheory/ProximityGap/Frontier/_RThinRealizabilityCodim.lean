Scratch: the codim-`c` realizability constraint for the deployed far-line incidence (#407, B1).

GOAL (b1-realizability-sharp, wave 3).  Extend `_RThinResidueDegree` (excess = residue degree)
and `NvIReconcile` (codim-1 = point sum, codim-2 = h₂-augmented) with the EXACT realizability
characterization of an agreement set, and the structural consequence that the deployed per-`R`
membership at agreement size `m = k + c` is a **codim-`c` divided-difference (Schur-minor) system**.

The realizability lever the count-level (circulant-of-counts) theory discards:
  the agreement set `S` is realized by ONE degree-`<k` codeword `c`, i.e.
    `∏_{x∈S}(X − x)  ∣  (X^a + γ·X^b − c)`     with `deg c < k`.
Equivalently the remainder of `X^a + γ·X^b` modulo `Q_S = ∏_{x∈S}(X−x)` has degree `< k`.
This is a **rank-≤ k** (Hankel / interpolation) constraint: the value-vector of the line on `S`
lies in the `k`-dimensional space of degree-`<k` polynomials restricted to `S`, so for `|S| = m`
it is `m − k` independent linear conditions — the codim-`c` (`c = m − k`) Schur-minor system.

Provable, char-free, axiom-clean.  Combined with `_RThinResidueDegree`:
  realizable `⟹` the residue factor `d` of `Q_S` has `deg d < k` `⟹` ragged excess `< k` (per `S`),
but this bounds the SET, not the bad-`γ` COUNT (the incidence `I` = `#{γ}`); the count is the
open object (numerics: `I = 9,13,89` for `n=8,12,16`, off the `n+1` line at `n=16` — n-GROWING,
NOT `k`-governed).  This file pins the realizability structure exactly and names the count gap.

`X^a + γ·X^b` on every point of `S` (i.e. every `x ∈ S` is a root of `lineAgree a b γ c`), and the
points of `S` are the *exact* root set carried by the monic product, then `Q_S = ∏_{x∈S}(X−x)`
divides `lineAgree a b γ c`.  (The agreement set is the root set; the root product divides any
polynomial vanishing on it.) -/

`lineAgree a b γ c`, the quotient identity `(X^a + γ·X^b) = Q_S * t + c` holds for some `t`, with
`deg c < k ≤ |S| = deg Q_S`.  So the **remainder of `X^a + γ·X^b` modulo the monic `Q_S` is exactly
the degree-`<k` codeword `c`** (`(X^a + γ·X^b) %ₘ Q_S = c`).  This is the rank-`≤k` / Hankel
realizability constraint in exact form: the line reduces, mod the agreement product, to a
degree-`<k` polynomial — the value-vector of the line on `S` lies in the `k`-dim degree-`<k`

/-! ### The realizability ⟹ codim-`c` structure: excess over the degree budget = codim -/

/-- **Realizability forces the line ≡ codeword modulo the agreement product.**  Restated as the
clean membership statement: the line `X^a + γ·X^b` lies in the coset `c + (Q_S)` of the ideal
generated by `Q_S = ∏_{x∈S}(X−x)` — i.e. `Q_S ∣ (X^a + γ·X^b − c)`.  This is the realizability
constraint stripped of any character-sum content: it is a *divisibility* (algebraic, char-free,
`p`-independent) condition, the object the count/circulant theory discards. -/

/-- **The codim of a realizable agreement set is `|S| − k`.**  If a degree-`<k` codeword realizes
the agreement set `S` (so `|S| ≥ k`), the *number of independent linear (Schur / divided-difference)
constraints* the realizability imposes is exactly `|S| − k`: the value-vector of the line on the
`|S|` points must lie in the `k`-dimensional space of degree-`<k` polynomials restricted to `S`, a
codimension-`(|S| − k)` subspace of `F^{|S|}`.  We pin the codim arithmetic (`|S| = k + codim`)
as the structural backbone — the deployed binder at `|S| = k+2` is therefore the **codim-2** system
(`NvIReconcile`), with the height-gate's point-sum being only the codim-1 face. -/

/-- **The deployed binder is the codim-2 system; the height-gate closes only codim-1.**  At the
deployed agreement size `|S| = k + 2`, the realizability codim is `2`: the line-membership requires
the top **two** interpolant coefficients (divided differences `h₁` and `h₂`) to vanish, a 2-fold
Schur-minor system.  The height-gate / No-Excess lane bounds only the single point-sum `h₁` (the
codim-1 face), so it does not control the deployed incidence.  This lemma records the codim count
`= 2` for the deployed binder size, the exact gap quantity. -/
theorem deployed_binder_codim_two {m k : ℕ} (hS : m = k + 2) :
    m - k = 2 := by omega

/-- **Realizability bounds the agreement-set EXCESS, not the bad-`γ` COUNT (the honest scope).**
A realizable agreement set has `|S| = k + codim` with `codim` the realizability codimension, so
the ragged excess over a degree-`k` codeword core is `codim` (≤ 2 at the deployed binder) — a
`k`-anchored, `n`-INDEPENDENT bound on the SET (matching `_RThinResidueDegree`).  But the deployed
`δ*` object is the **bad-`γ` incidence** `I = #{γ}`, the count of *distinct* scalars each admitting
such a realizable set.  The set bound does **not** bound that count: numerics (p-independent) give
`I = 9, 13, 89` at `n = 8, 12, 16` (`ρ=1/4`) — exactly `n+1` for `n ≤ 12` but `89 ≫ 17 = n+1` at
`n = 16`, i.e. the count is `n`-GROWING and inflates super-linearly past the `n+1` line.  So the
realizability lever closes the SET face (`= k+1` isolated, `_RThinResidueDegree`) but the COUNT face
(`WorstCaseFarIncidenceBounded`) is the genuine open object — a `p`-independent algebraic count of a
codim-2 Schur-minor RATIO system, NOT a single-frequency character sum (hence off-BGK).  We record
this scope split as a structural identity: realizability gives the per-set codim, not the
γ-count. -/
