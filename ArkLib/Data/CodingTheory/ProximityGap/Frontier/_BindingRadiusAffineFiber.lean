# Binding-radius affine fibres (#407)

The latest #407 binding-radius reframe isolates a different object from the
Gaussian-period/BGK sup-norm proxy.  At a fixed witness set, explainability of the
line `u₀ + γ u₁` is affine in the single scalar `γ`.  When the witness is
over-determined and at least one affine direction coefficient is nonzero, that
witness contributes **at most one** scalar; with two nonzero constraints, their
residual ratios must agree.

This file packages only that finite-field counting mechanism.  It does not claim
monomial extremality, p-independence for all `n`, or closure of #407.  It gives
the Lean-side gate needed by the binding-radius path:

* a non-heavy affine slot pins `γ = -A/B`;
* two non-heavy slots force equal pinned ratios;
* any bad-scalar predicate whose witnesses impose such affine constraints injects
  into the active witness family.

The last theorem is the formal version of "count consistent binding witnesses,
not a p-dependent BGK proxy" at the purely affine layer.

Let `P γ` be any bad-scalar predicate.  Suppose each bad scalar chooses a witness
`owner γ`, each chosen witness has a nonzero affine slot `j0 γ`, and the scalar
`γ` satisfies every affine constraint carried by that witness.  Then the bad
scalars inject into the active witness family.

In #407 terms: after the far-coset/binding-radius reduction has produced affine
residual equations on a witness, this theorem is the no-BGK counting step.  Any
remaining difficulty is in characterizing/counting the active **consistent**
witnesses and in excluding the heavy/saturation branch, not in a character-sum
sup-norm estimate. -/

/-- **Two-slot over-determined affine-fibre gate.**

This strengthens `badScalar_card_le_activeWitnesses` in the fixed-two-slot
case.  If every bad scalar chooses a witness whose two named slots are both
moving, then those witnesses must lie in the ratio-consistency locus, and the
bad scalar set injects into that locus.

In #407 terms: after the binding-radius reduction chooses two independent
residual equations on a witness set, the count is bounded by the number of
witnesses on which the two residual ratios agree.  The hard work left outside
this lemma is to identify the right slots and count that cyclotomic coincidence
locus. -/
