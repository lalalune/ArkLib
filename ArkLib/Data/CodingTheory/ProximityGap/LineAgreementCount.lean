# Per-codeword line-agreement count (#232, MCA→Johnson building block)

A genuinely novel elementary brick toward the open MCA→Johnson regime. The hard part of
bounding the MCA error over the affine line `{u₀ + γ·u₁}` is *bivariate*; but the
**per-codeword** sub-count is a clean pigeonhole on the line's per-coordinate solution map.

  `line_agree_count_mul_le` — for words `u₀, u₁, c`, the number of scalars `γ` at
  which the line point `u₀ + γ·u₁` agrees with `c` on at least `a` coordinates,
  times `(a − b₀)`, is at most the Hamming weight of `u₁`, where
  `b₀ = #{i : u₁ i = 0 ∧ u₀ i = c i}` is the always-agree count.

Reason: at a coordinate `i` with `u₁ i ≠ 0`, the equation `u₀ i + γ·u₁ i = c i`
has the *unique* solution `γ = (c i − u₀ i)/u₁ i`, so agreement with `c` at index
`i` (for `u₁ i ≠ 0`) pins `γ`. Thus
`agree(γ) = b₀ + #{i : u₁ i ≠ 0, γ = γ_i}`, and summing the second term over all
`γ` counts each support coordinate once (`= weight(u₁)`). Each high-agreement `γ`
contributes `≥ a − b₀`, giving the bound by double counting.

This is the codeword-local half of the BCIKS20 correlated-agreement argument; the remaining
(open/research-scale) part is bounding the *number of codewords* that any line point can be close to
beyond the Johnson radius. Axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).

/-- **Per-codeword line-agreement count.** The scalars `γ` whose line point
`u₀ + γ·u₁` agrees with `c` on `≥ a` coordinates are few: their count times
`(a − b₀)` is at most `weight(u₁)`, where
`b₀ = #{i : u₁ i = 0 ∧ u₀ i = c i}`. A single fixed codeword can be hit with high
agreement by only `≤ weight(u₁)/(a − b₀)` scalars on the line. -/
