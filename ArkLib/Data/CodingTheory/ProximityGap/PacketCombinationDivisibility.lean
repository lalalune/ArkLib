# Issue #232 — the packet-combination divisibility brick (O87's prime-power recursion seed)

O87 (`DeBruijnIndicatorDisjointness.lean`) closed de Bruijn step (3) at the squarefree
level and measured exactly where it stops: at prime powers the naive dichotomy fails
(168/486 column pairs at `n = 12, 18`), while EVERY CRT column indicator difference is
divisible by `Φ_{p^a}` (probe check C6, 100% there).  The named next brick is the
**packet-combination form** of that divisibility, proven here in full:

a polynomial `d` divisible by the geometric packet
`packet p q = Σ_{t<p} X^(t·q)` (at `q = p^(a-1)` this IS `Φ_{p^a}`, by
`Polynomial.cyclotomic_prime_pow_eq_geom_sum`) with `natDegree d < p·q` satisfies:

* `quotient_natDegree_lt` — **the degree bound**: the quotient `R` (with
  `d = packet·R`) has `natDegree R < q` — degree bookkeeping forced by
  `natDegree packet = (p−1)·q`.
* `quotient_coeff_eq_bottom` + `packet_mul_coeff` — **the bottom-slice identity**:
  `R` is read off the bottom coefficient slice of `d` (`R.coeff s = d.coeff s` for
  `s < q`); the convolution against the sparse packet support never reaches down.
* `packet_dvd_combination` — **the headline**: `d` IS the combination
  `d = Σ_{s<q} C (d.coeff s) · X^s · packet` of rotated packets, with combination
  coefficients literally bottom coefficients of `d` — so any coefficient bound on `d`
  transfers verbatim.  `indicator_diff_packet_combination` instantiates this at
  indicator differences (coefficients in `{−1, 0, 1}`), the O87-named statement.
* `packet_dvd_iff_slice_replication` — the recursion-usable characterization: on
  `natDegree d < p·q`, packet divisibility is EQUIVALENT to the `p`-fold slice
  replication `d.coeff (t·q + s) = d.coeff s` — the form the `a ≥ 2` de Bruijn
  recursion consumes (column differences at level `a` become slice data at `a − 1`).
* `cyclotomic_dvd_combination` / `indicator_diff_cyclotomic_combination` — the bricks
  restated verbatim on `Φ_{p^(a+1)}`, the C6 surface.

The packet statements need NO primality (`p, q ≥ 1` arbitrary; primality only enters
in naming `packet p (p^a) = Φ_{p^(a+1)}`), and no characteristic hypothesis — any
nontrivial integral domain.

Falsified first (`scripts/probes/probe_packet_quotient_coeffs.py`, exact integer
arithmetic, exit 0): exhaustively over all vanishing subsets at `n = 12` (600 column
pairs) and `n = 18` (2000 pairs) — divisibility (O87 C6 re-verified), quotient degree
`< q`, quotient coefficients in `{−1,0,1}`, the bottom-slice identity, and the exact
reconstruction; the FULL `{−1,0,1}^q` quotient cube is realized by real indicator
differences (9/9 at 12, 27/27 at 18).  Controls: without `deg d < p^a` the
shifts-`< q` combination fails (`d = Φ·X^q`; the bottom-slice identity holds for ANY
quotient — the degree bound's job is to make the bottom slice the WHOLE quotient);
exact census: the divisible `{−1,0,1}`-vectors of length `p^a` are EXACTLY
`{Φ·R : R ∈ {−1,0,1}^q}`, count `3^q` (9 of 81; 27 of 19683) — the bijection this
file proves, with non-divisible vectors witnessing that divisibility is load-bearing.

What remains for full de Bruijn (named, not claimed): consume this brick — recurse
down the `q`-adic digits using `packet_dvd_iff_slice_replication` to descend the
column data of `MixedRadixTower` / `DeBruijnIndicatorDisjointness` from level `a` to
`a − 1`, and assemble mixed disjoint packets at composite levels.
