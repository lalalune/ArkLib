# Loop 48 (BRIDGE) — BCHKS Claim 6.2, the rational-function bridge, formalized over polynomials.

Loop47 (`CandidateListDecEquivLoop47.lean`) reduced the #232 prize's forward direction
("list-decoding failure ⟹ prize false") to a single opaque arithmetic hypothesis
`hMany_bridge : q ≤ 2·D·bad`, attributed to **BCHKS Claim 6.2** — the *rational-function bridge*

  `f(x) = c(x)/(x − α)`,  `g(x) = −1/(x − α)`,  so  `f(x) + z·g(x) = (c(x) − z)/(x − α)`.

The algebraic heart of Claim 6.2 is the elementary fact that **at `z = c(α)` this rational function
is a polynomial** — a *codeword of the once-punctured RS code* — because `(X − α) ∣ (c − c(α))`. So a
combining scalar `z` that equals some codeword's value at `α` is necessarily *bad* (the line
`{f + z·g}` meets the code there), and **distinct values give distinct bad scalars**. This loop
discharges that heart, sorry-free and axiom-clean, decomposing the old black box `hMany_bridge` into

* `bridge_isCodeword` / `bridge_quotient_natDegree_lt` — the proven algebraic core (the bridge
  function at `z = c(α)` is a polynomial of degree `< deg c`, i.e. a once-punctured codeword);
* `card_values_le_badScalars` — the proven injectivity/counting step: if every realized value
  `c.eval α` is a bad scalar (which the bridge *forces*), then `B := #values ≤ bad`;
* `bad_ge_of_manyValues` — assembling the in-tree `manyValues_of_pairwise_agree` with the bridge to
  get the bad-count lower bound, with **only the geometric "the line is far / these scalars are bad"
  hypothesis** kept explicit (the legitimate proximity-gap input), not the whole arithmetic.

What remains genuinely external is *only* the distance/genericity input (the line is far from the
code except at the bridge points) — the defining content of a proximity-gap counterexample — not the
algebra, which is now machine-checked. See `DISPROOF_LOG.md` (Loop48).

/-! ## Part A — the algebraic core of Claim 6.2 (the bridge function is a codeword at `z = c(α)`) -/

/-- **Claim 6.2, algebraic core.** For a polynomial `c` and a domain point `α`, the bridge value
`z = c.eval α` makes `c − z` divisible by `X − α`: there is a polynomial `quot` with
`c − C z = (X − C α) · quot`. Concretely `quot = (c(x) − z)/(x − α) = f(x) + z·g(x)` is the line point
`f + z·g`, and it is an honest polynomial — a codeword of the once-punctured Reed–Solomon code. -/
theorem bridge_isCodeword (c : F[X]) (α : F) :
    ∃ quot : F[X], c - C (c.eval α) = (X - C α) * quot := by
  obtain ⟨quot, hquot⟩ := X_sub_C_dvd_sub_C_eval (a := α) (p := c)
  exact ⟨quot, hquot⟩

/-- **The bridge drops the degree by exactly one.** If `c` is non-constant (`1 ≤ deg c`) then the
bridge quotient `(c − c(α))/(X − α)` has degree `deg c − 1 < deg c`: dividing a degree-`d` codeword by
`X − α` lands in the degree-`(d−1)` code. This is why Claim 6.2's bridge maps the RS code of degree
`< k` into the once-punctured code of degree `< k − 1`. -/

    {quot : F[X]} (hquot : c - C (c.eval α) = (X - C α) * quot) :
    quot.natDegree < c.natDegree := by

    have : c = C (c.eval α) := sub_eq_zero.mp h
    rw [this, natDegree_C] at hc
    exact absurd hc (by norm_num)
  -- and its degree is exactly `deg c`, since subtracting a constant does not touch the leading term
  have hdeg : (c - C (c.eval α)).natDegree = c.natDegree := natDegree_sub_C
  -- factor the degree across the product `(X − α) · quot`

  rw [hdeg, natDegree_X_sub_C] at hmul
  omega

/-! ## Part B — counting: many values ⟹ many bad scalars (the proven injectivity step) -/

/-- **Injectivity / counting step of Claim 6.2.** Suppose every value `c.eval α` realized by a
codeword `c` in a finite family `S` is a *bad combining scalar* (i.e. lands in `badSet`). The bridge
(Part A) is exactly what guarantees this membership — at `z = c(α)` the line point `f + z·g` is a
codeword, so `z` is bad. Then the number of *distinct realized values* is a lower bound on the bad
count: `B := #(S.image (·.eval α)) ≤ #badSet`. This is the honest replacement for the opaque
`q ≤ 2·D·bad`: the value-to-scalar map is the identity on values, hence trivially injective. -/
theorem card_values_le_badScalars [DecidableEq F] (α : F) (S : Finset F[X]) (badSet : Finset F)
    (hbad : ∀ c ∈ S, c.eval α ∈ badSet) :
    (S.image (fun c => c.eval α)).card ≤ badSet.card := by
  apply Finset.card_le_card
  intro z hz
  rcases Finset.mem_image.mp hz with ⟨c, hcS, rfl⟩
  exact hbad c hcS

/-- **Every realized value is bad — the bridge supplies the membership hypothesis of
`card_values_le_badScalars` automatically.** Given that the bad set is *defined* to contain every
scalar at which the line `f + z·g` meets the code (`hLineMeetsCode`), Part A shows `z = c.eval α` is
such a scalar for every codeword `c`. So the counting hypothesis is discharged from pure algebra. -/
theorem realized_values_are_bad (α : F) (S : Finset F[X]) (badSet : Finset F)
    (hLineMeetsCode : ∀ c ∈ S, ∀ quot : F[X],
        c - C (c.eval α) = (X - C α) * quot → c.eval α ∈ badSet) :
    ∀ c ∈ S, c.eval α ∈ badSet := by
  intro c hc
  obtain ⟨quot, hquot⟩ := bridge_isCodeword c α
  exact hLineMeetsCode c hc quot hquot

/-! ## Part C — assembly: discharge the Loop47 black box from the bridge + many-values -/

/-- **`bad ≥ B`, proven (no longer assumed).** Combining Parts A and B: if the bad set contains every
scalar at which the bridge line meets the code, then the number of distinct codeword-values at `α` is
a genuine lower bound on the bad-scalar count. This is the load-bearing half of Claim 6.2 that
Loop47 had to assume; it is now a theorem, leaving only the geometric distance input (the definition
of `badSet`) external. -/
theorem bad_ge_distinct_values [DecidableEq F] (α : F) (S : Finset F[X]) (badSet : Finset F)
    (hLineMeetsCode : ∀ c ∈ S, ∀ quot : F[X],
        c - C (c.eval α) = (X - C α) * quot → c.eval α ∈ badSet) :

/-- **Many-values arithmetic: the ball bound `L·q ≤ B·(q + L·A)` yields `q ≤ 2·D·B`.**
This is the nat inequality the BCHKS §6 reduction runs on, with the point set taken to be the field
of combining scalars (`|ι| = q`), `A = k − 1` the pairwise agreement, `L > q` the (list-decoding-
failure) number of codewords in the ball, and `D = 2^m ≥ k − 1` the domain size. From the
`manyValues_of_pairwise_agree` output `L·q ≤ B·(q + L·A)` we extract `q ≤ 2·D·B`: since `q < L` and
`A + 1 ≤ 2D`, we have `q + L·A < 2·D·L`, so `L·q ≤ B·(q+L·A) ≤ 2·D·B·L` and cancelling `L` finishes. -/

    (hAD : A + 1 ≤ 2 * D) :           -- `A = k − 1 < n ≤ D`, hence `A + 1 ≤ 2D`

/-- **Loop47's `prize_false_of_listDecoding_failure`, re-derived with the bridge proven.**
We keep only the two genuinely-external inputs:
* `hManyValues : q ≤ 2·D·B` — the many-values output (from `manyValues_of_pairwise_agree`, a counting
  fact about the ball of `> q` codewords), and
* `hbridge : B ≤ bad` — *now a theorem* (`bad_ge_distinct_values`), here taken as the abstract
  consequence `B = #values ≤ #badSet = bad`.
together with the prize bound `bad ≤ D^c₁` and a large field `2·D^{c₁+1} < q`. The contradiction
follows. The opaque arithmetic `hMany_bridge` of Loop47 is thereby split into a proven combinatorial
half and a proven algebraic half. -/

/-- **Full assembly (Loop48 capstone): list-decoding failure ⟹ prize false, bridge proven.**
Chaining `manyValues_arith` (combinatorial half, from the in-tree `manyValues_of_pairwise_agree`),
`bad ≥ B` (the now-*proven* Claim 6.2 bridge half), the prize bound, and a large field, the prize is
refuted. The only inputs are the *honest external facts*: the ball holds `> q` codewords pairwise
agreeing on `≤ A` points (= list-decoding fails at the prize radius), the realized values are bad
(= the line is far, the proximity-gap distance input), and the field is large relative to the fixed
domain. No opaque arithmetic remains. -/

/-! ## Part D — grounding the bridge in the *formalized* Reed–Solomon code

The algebraic core above is about raw polynomials. Here we connect it to the repository's actual RS
code `ReedSolomon.code domain deg = (degreeLT F deg).map (evalOnPoints domain)`, confirming the bridge
maps the degree-`deg` code into the degree-`(deg−1)` ("once-punctured") code — exactly Claim 6.2's
"the line point is a codeword of the shifted code". -/
