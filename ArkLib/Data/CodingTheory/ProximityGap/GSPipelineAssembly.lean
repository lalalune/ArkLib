Round 14 — Angle D: the Guruswami–Sudan ASSEMBLY (ArkLib #232, proximity-prize GS route).

CONTENT (all fully proved, no placeholders):

1. `root_cap` — the GS Y-degree cap: a nonzero bivariate `Q : F[X][Y]` admits at most
   `Q.natDegree` (its `Y`-degree) distinct polynomials `f` with `(Y - C f) ∣ Q`.
   Proof: each such `f` is a root of `Q` over the integral domain `F[X]`, and a nonzero
   polynomial over a domain has at most `natDegree` roots.

2. `gs_list_bound` — the conditional GS assembly: for evaluation points `α : Fin n → F`
   and received word `w : Fin n → F`, IF some nonzero `Q : F[X][Y]` has `Y`-degree ≤ L
   and `(Y - C f) ∣ Q` for every `f` of degree < k agreeing with `w` on ≥ t points
   (the interpolation + root-order front end, packaged as a hypothesis), THEN the list
   `{f : deg f < k, agree(f, w) ≥ t}` is finite of size ≤ L.

3. Full discharge of the hypothesis on a concrete RS instance (Sudan-style, m = 1):
   `F = ZMod 7`, n = 6, k = 2, α = (0,1,2,3,4,5), w = (0,0,0,3,4,5), t = 3,
   `Q(X,Y) = Y·(Y - X)` (so L = 2). `Q` is nonzero, has `Y`-degree exactly 2, vanishes
   at all six points `(αᵢ, wᵢ)` (`Qc_vanishes`), and the divisibility hypothesis is
   genuinely proved (`vanishing_concrete`): any degree-<2 polynomial agreeing with `w`
   on ≥ 3 of the 6 points is `0` or `X` (a kernel-checked classification over all 49
   candidate lines), and both `Y - C 0` and `Y - C X` divide `Q`.

4. End-to-end firing: `gs_concrete` (list ≤ 2) and exactness `theList_eq`/`gs_main`
   (the list is exactly `{0, X}`, of size exactly 2 — the bound is tight, hence
   non-vacuous: the list is nonempty and even has TWO elements).

HONEST SCOPE. The radius here is the genuine LIST-decoding regime but not past Johnson:
t = 3 agreements out of n = 6 with k = 2 is strictly beyond unique decoding
(unique decoding needs t ≥ ⌈(n + k)/2⌉ = 4; indeed the output list has two codewords),
and satisfies the Sudan/GS condition t > √((k-1)n) = √6 ≈ 2.45. The Johnson bound at
these parameters also certifies small lists, so this instance does NOT push past Johnson;
no claim to the contrary is made. What this file contributes is the verified end-to-end
GS pipeline skeleton — conditional assembly + a fully discharged concrete instance —
which is the scaffold any past-Johnson refinement of the interpolation step would plug
into (only the hypothesis `hvan` of `gs_list_bound` would change).
