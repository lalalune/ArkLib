# The Gauss-Phase Resonance — the named free variable of the Proximity Prize (#407)

After the algebra (substitute the DFT form `eta_b = (1/m) sum_j chibar^j(b) tau(chi^j)` into the moment
identity `sum_b |eta_b|^{2r} = p E_r`, cancel `sqrt p` via the **unit phases** `u_l = tau(chi^l)/sqrt p`
(`‖u_l‖ = 1`, since `tau(chi^l) tau(chibar^l) = chi^l(-1) p`), and collapse the `b`-sum by character
orthogonality), the entire open core of the prize isolates as a single **manifestly nonnegative,
pure-phase, sqrt-p-free** object. This file gives it a name, a definition, and the provable facts.

## The free variable

Let `m` be the (odd) index, `u : ZMod m → ℂ` the Gauss-sum **unit phases** (`‖u l‖ = 1`). For each depth
`r`, the **phase-sum** `P r c = sum over r-tuples X in (ZMod m \ 0)^r with (sum X = c) of (prod_i u (X i))`.
The open core is the **deep resonance moment**

> **`T r := sum_{c} ‖P r c‖²`   (= `(1/m) sum_b ‖xi b‖^{2r}`, `xi b` the DFT of the unit phases).**

The Parseval identity `(1/m) sum_b ‖xi b‖^{2r} = sum_c ‖P r c‖²` makes `T r` **manifestly nonnegative**
and free of both `sqrt p` and the additive moment `E_r`.

## The bridge and the conjecture (the whole prize, root-free)

`M(n) = max_{b≠0} ‖eta_b‖ = sqrt(n/m) * R`, `R = max_b ‖xi b‖`, and the prize floor `M ≤ sqrt(2 n log m)`
is **exactly** `R ≤ sqrt(2 m log m)` — equivalently `T r ≤ (2 m log m)^r` at depth `r ≍ log m`. This file
states that as the named open `Prop` `ResonanceConjecture` and proves the elementary facts. The deep
inequality (`r ≍ log m`) is the recognized open Gauss-period / BGK content; it is NOT proved here.

## What "Gauss is reducible" gives (recorded, not used here)

For composite index `m = q₁ q₂` the Hasse–Davenport relation `tau(chi^{q₂}) tau(chi^{q₁}) = J · tau(chi^{q₁+q₂})`
(verified exactly) factors the order-`m` Gauss sum into prime-order pieces, reducing the `m` phases to
`O(sum qᵢ + log² m)` fundamental phases. It does NOT cleanly tensorize the resonance (the Jacobi phase
`J/sqrt p` couples the factors; measured `M_m / (M_{q₁} M_{q₂}/sqrt p) ≈ 1.3–1.4`), but it is a genuine
dimensional reduction of the free variable. See `scripts/probes/probe_gauss_reducibility_tensor.py`.

/-- **The deep resonance moment `T r`** — the named free variable of the prize. It is the pure-phase,
`sqrt p`-free core into which the entire open problem collapses:
`T r = ∑_c ‖phaseSum u r c‖²`, manifestly nonnegative. -/

/-- **`T r ≥ 0`** — the free variable is manifestly nonnegative (a sum of squared norms). This is the
structural fact that the `sqrt p`-cancellation buys: the open core is a nonnegative quadratic form in
the Gauss-sum unit phases, with no field size and no additive moment `E_r` carried. -/

/-- **The Resonance Conjecture (the prize, root-free).** The deep resonance moment stays sub-`(2m log m)`
to depth `r ≍ log m`. This is the entire open core after the `sqrt p` and the `max` are cancelled:
`T r ≤ (2 m log m)^r` ⟺ `R = max_b ‖xi b‖ ≤ sqrt(2 m log m)` ⟺ `M(n) ≤ sqrt(2 n log m)` (the prize floor).
It is the named, isolated free variable; proving it is the recognized open Gauss-period/BGK problem and is
NOT asserted here. -/

exactly the Resonance Conjecture — which (composed with the proven `sqrt p`-cancellation `M = sqrt(n/m) R`
and the moment-to-max inference) is the prize floor `M ≤ sqrt(2 n log m)`. -/
