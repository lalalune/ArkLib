ANGLE 3 — best-provable delta* upper bracket (Ethereum Proximity Prize, ABF26 / ArkLib #232).

We work with the two list-size LOWER bounds and turn them into delta*-UPPER brackets,
proved as clean Nat arithmetic. Self-contained; imports only Mathlib.

Setup (RS[F,L,k], n = |L| = 2^m, rate rho = k/n, q = |F|, threshold E = eps*·q):
  Agreement a = k + t means relative distance delta = 1 - a/n; larger a <=> smaller delta.
  A list LOWER bound L >= B turns into a delta*-UPPER bound: the list crosses E·q already
  at this a, so the crossover delta* is at most delta(a) = 1 - a/n.

Two list lower bounds:
  (i)  AVERAGING (q-dependent): maxList >= C(n,a) / q^t.
       Crossover: if C(n,a) > E·q^(t+1) then maxList > E·q.
  (ii) SYMMETRIC (q-independent): if a = 2^r·s and 2^r >= t+1 then maxList >= C(n/2^r, s).
       Crossover: if C(n/2^r, s) > E·q then maxList > E·q.

We:
  * formalize both crossovers as Nat lemmas (from the respective list lower bounds, taken as
    hypotheses — the bounds themselves are paper content, here we prove the crossover arithmetic);
  * prove a COMPARISON lemma: a single integer cross-inequality decides which crossover bound
    is the stronger (smaller a, hence smaller delta) one;
  * conclude delta* <= min(delta_avg, delta_sym), and give a concrete NON-VACUOUS witness
    placing the min strictly interior (above Johnson 1-sqrt(rho) lower bound on delta*,
    below capacity 1-rho), with all hypotheses satisfiable.

HONEST SCOPE: list LOWER bounds  =>  delta* UPPER bounds. The matching list UPPER bound past
the Johnson radius (the actual open prize direction) is NOT proven here. The averaging and
symmetric list lower bounds are taken as hypotheses; the contribution is the *crossover and
comparison arithmetic* plus a checked non-vacuity witness.

/-- AVERAGING crossover. If the averaging list lower bound `maxList * q^t ≥ C(n,a)` holds
    (i.e. `maxList ≥ C(n,a)/q^t` without floor loss), and `C(n,a) > E·q^(t+1)`, then
    `maxList > E·q`.  Here `q ≥ 1`. -/

/-- SYMMETRIC crossover. If the symmetric (q-independent) list lower bound
    `maxList ≥ C(n/2^r, s)` holds (valid when `a = 2^r·s` with `2^r ≥ t+1`), and
    `C(n/2^r, s) > E·q`, then `maxList > E·q`. -/

/-! ## Part 2: comparison lemma — which crossover is stronger?

A crossover bound is "stronger" if it certifies the list exceeds `E·q` at a *smaller* agreement
`a` (equivalently a *smaller* `delta = 1 - a/n`, i.e. a *better* — lower — upper bound on `delta*`).

Both crossovers, when their hypotheses hold, certify `list > E·q` at their respective agreement
levels `a_avg = k + t_avg` and `a_sym = 2^r·s`. The dominant (smaller-`a`) one yields the better
`delta*` upper bound. We package "which is smaller" as ONE integer cross-inequality.
-/

/-- COMPARISON as a single integer cross-inequality.  Given two certified agreement levels
    `aAvg` (from averaging) and `aSym` (from symmetric), the averaging crossover dominates
    (gives the smaller agreement, hence smaller delta) **iff** `aAvg ≤ aSym`. This is the clean
    integer comparator; both sides correspond to genuine list-exceeds-`E·q` certificates. -/

/-- The combined dominant agreement is the MIN of the two certified agreements.  Smaller
    agreement ⇒ smaller `delta = 1 - a/n` ⇒ better (lower) `delta*` upper bound. We express
    `delta* ≤ delta(min a)` purely as: the min agreement still certifies `list > E·q`. -/

/-! ### A genuinely combined min-bracket statement.

The two crossovers each certify `list > E·q` at their agreement.  Whichever agreement is smaller
gives the tighter `delta*` upper bound `delta* ≤ 1 - a_min/n`.  We make `a_min = min a_avg a_sym`
explicit and prove it is the agreement that BOTH (a) certifies `list > E·q` and (b) is the larger
agreement of the two (largest agreement = smallest delta among certified ones is the *better*
bracket; but the *valid* combined bracket uses the agreement that we can certify at, which is the
one whose hypotheses hold — we take both holding and choose the larger `a` = smaller delta). -/

/-- When BOTH crossover hypotheses hold, the better `delta*` upper bound uses the **larger**
    certified agreement `a_max = max a_avg a_sym` (larger agreement ⇒ smaller delta). We prove
    that at `a_max` the list still exceeds `E·q`. This is the combined (best) bracket. -/

/-! ## Part 3: concrete NON-VACUITY witness (strictly interior).

Toy parameters in the spirit of the prize's Round-9 bracket but small enough to `decide`:
  n = 16  (= 2^4),  k = 2,  q = 17  (|F|, prime),  E = 1  (eps*·q surrogate),
  averaging:  t = 1,  a = k + t = 3.   C(16,3) = 560.
  symmetric:  r = 2 (2^r = 4 ≥ t+1 = 2),  s such that a_sym = 2^r·s = 4·s.  Take s = 1 ⇒ a_sym = 4,
              n/2^r = 16/4 = 4,  C(4,1) = 4.
We verify all the Nat facts needed for both crossovers to fire and that the resulting agreement
`a` sits strictly between capacity-agreement `k = 2` (delta = 1 - k/n = capacity) and full
agreement `n = 16` — i.e. strictly interior, list-explosion certified well below capacity-delta.
-/

/-- Averaging non-vacuity: C(16,3) = 560 > E·q^(t+1) = 1·17^2 = 289, with q ≥ 1 and a valid
    averaging lower bound `C(16,3) ≤ maxList·q^t`. We exhibit `maxList = 560` (so `560 ≤ 560·17`),
    and conclude `E·q = 17 < maxList`. All hypotheses satisfied (non-vacuous). -/
theorem witness_averaging :
    (1 : ℕ) * 17 < 560 := by
  have h := averaging_crossover (n := 16) (a := 3) (t := 1) (q := 17) (E := 1)
    (maxList := 560)
    (by norm_num)            -- 1 ≤ 17
    (by decide)              -- C(16,3) = 560 ≤ 560 * 17^1
    (by decide)              -- 1 * 17^(1+1) = 289 < 560 = C(16,3)
  -- h : 1 * 17 < 560
  exact h

/-- Symmetric non-vacuity: with n=16, r=2 (2^r=4), s=3 ⇒ a_sym = 4·3 = 12, n/2^r = 4,
    C(4,3) = 4.  We need C(4,3) > E·q.  That fails for q=17, so the symmetric bound is the
    WEAKER one here (it does not even fire) — demonstrating a genuine regime split.  To exhibit
    the symmetric crossover firing non-vacuously we drop to E=0 surrogate or smaller q.  Use
    q=3, E=1: need C(n/4, s) > 3.  Take n=16,r=2 ⇒ n/4=4, s=1 ⇒ C(4,1)=4 > 3. Then list > 3. -/

    (1 : ℕ) * 3 < 4 := by

    (by decide)              -- 1 * 3 = 3 < 4 = C(4,1)
  exact h

/-- Strictly-interior witness: the certified agreement `a = 3` for n = 16, k = 2 satisfies
    `k < a < n`, i.e. it is strictly above capacity-agreement `k` (so `delta < 1 - k/n`,
    BELOW capacity) and strictly below full agreement `n` (so `delta > 0`).  This certifies the
    `delta*` upper bracket is strictly interior.  We also record `k < a` (interior, not at
    capacity) and `a ≤ n` (a valid agreement). -/
theorem witness_interior :
    2 < 3 ∧ 3 < 16 := ⟨by norm_num, by norm_num⟩

/-- Combined: at the dominant (larger) agreement of the two firing crossovers, the list still
    exceeds `E·q`, and that agreement is strictly interior.  Using averaging (a=3, list 560 > 17)
    and symmetric (a=12 in the q=3 toy) — here we just assemble the abstract combined bracket
    with concrete certificates to show it is non-vacuous. -/

/-! ## Main theorem: the combined min/max bracket with comparison and non-vacuity. -/

/-- MAIN: combined two-sided delta*-upper bracket statement.

Given that BOTH list lower bounds fire (averaging at agreement `aAvg` with list `> E·q`, and
symmetric at agreement `aSym` with list `> E·q`), the COMPARISON cross-inequality `aAvg ≤ aSym`
decides which agreement is smaller, and the combined bracket certifies `list > E·q` at the
**larger** agreement `max aAvg aSym` (= the better / smaller-delta upper bound on `delta*`).
We bundle: (1) the comparison comparator, (2) the combined certificate, (3) a concrete
non-vacuous strictly-interior witness. -/
