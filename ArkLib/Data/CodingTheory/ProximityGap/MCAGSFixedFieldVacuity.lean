# The per-domain "uniform GS-exposed prize" is closed — as stated, it is the proven trivial bound

`epsMCAgsPrizeUniformConjecture` (`GrandChallenge141PrizeMath.lean`) was introduced as "the honest
open GS-exposed prize", with the constant triple quantified before the per-rate data. But the
**evaluation domain (hence the field `F`) is fixed before the existential**, so the statement is
character-for-character the per-domain `epsMCAgs_prizeBound_conjecture domain m` (`MCAGS.lean`) —
which `epsMCAgs_prizeBound_conjecture_holds` (`GrandChallenge141UniformResolved.lean`) proves
outright by fixed-field inflation: take `c₁ = c₂ = 0` and `c₃ = n` with `(15/16)^n ≤ 1/|F|`; the
prize rates are bounded below by `1/16`, so `η ≤ 15/16` uniformly and the bound inflates past `1`.

This file records the discharge, de-laundering the "deliberately unproved" label: the statement
*as formalized* carries no open content. The genuinely open prize is the **field-universal** form
`epsMCAgsPrizeUniversalConjecture` (`GrandChallenge141PrizeReduction.lean`), whose constants are
quantified before the field and therefore cannot absorb `q = |F|`; its open core is the beyond-UDR
Guruswami–Sudan list-decoder mass bound (`UniversalGSListMassBound`). Tracking: issue #141.
