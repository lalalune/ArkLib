# Direction A, made concrete: explicit moment list bounds (#232)

Ties together the moment identities (`ListSizeMoments.lean`) and the ball-volume closed form
(`BallVolume.lean`): the abstract ball volume `V(r)` is replaced by `Σ_{i≤r} C(n,i)(q-1)^i`, so the
first-moment worst-case list bound becomes a fully explicit inequality in `n = |ι|`, `q = |F|`, `r`.

* `ballVol_closed` — `V(r) = Σ_{i≤r} C(n,i)·(q-1)^i` (bridging `hammingDist 0 = hammingNorm`).
* `exists_large_list_concrete` — some received word has list size `≥ |C|·Σ_{i≤r}C(n,i)(q-1)^i / qⁿ`,
  the explicit averaged lower bound (concrete form of `exists_large_list`).
* `covering_lower_bound_concrete` — the Paley-Zygmund/Cauchy-Schwarz covered-set lower bound with
  the same closed-form volume substituted.
* `covering_lower_bound_linear_concrete` — the linear-code version with the exact second moment
  rewritten as the weight-enumerator pair-ball sum.
