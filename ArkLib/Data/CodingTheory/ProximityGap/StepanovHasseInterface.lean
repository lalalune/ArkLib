# Issue #232 — the LINEAR (Hasse-derivative) entry point for univariate Stepanov constructions.

`StepanovPointCountEngine.lean` provides the **counting half** of Stepanov's method: a nonzero
auxiliary `Ψ` vanishing to *root multiplicity* `≥ M` at every point of a candidate set `V` gives
`|V|·M ≤ Ψ.natDegree`. A concrete Stepanov construction, however, produces its auxiliary by a
**linear-algebra dimension count** (`MultiplicityInterpolation.exists_ne_zero_map_eq_zero`: a linear
map into a lower-dimensional space has a nonzero kernel element), and the natural vanishing conditions
that count produces are the **Hasse-derivative** equations `(hasseDeriv k Ψ).eval a = 0` for `k < M` —
*not* a root-multiplicity hypothesis directly. (In characteristic `p`, iterated ordinary derivatives
miss the order of vanishing; the Hasse derivative is the correct char-`p`-safe notion.)

This file supplies the missing bridge and the resulting clean interface:

* `rootMultiplicity_ge_of_hasseDeriv_eval_eq_zero` — if `Ψ ≠ 0` and `(hasseDeriv k Ψ).eval a = 0` for
  all `k < M`, then `M ≤ Ψ.rootMultiplicity a` (via `taylor_coeff` + `X_pow_dvd_iff` +
  `le_rootMultiplicity_iff`, transported through the `taylorEquiv` algebra equivalence).
* `stepanov_card_mul_lt_of_hasse` — the **entry point**: a nonzero `Ψ` of `natDegree < D` whose Hasse
  derivatives of every order `k < M` vanish at every point of `V` forces `|V|·M < D`.

So a univariate Stepanov application now factors cleanly as: (1) build the linear map encoding
"vanish to order `M` at the structured points" (`hasseDeriv`-eval conditions); (2) dimension-count a
nonzero `Ψ` of bounded degree in its kernel; (3) the **non-vanishing** of that `Ψ` (the genuine
structural crux); then this interface delivers the point bound automatically.

## Scope / honest status

This is reusable Stepanov **scaffolding**, not the Weil bound. Toward issue #232 the target is the
Weil bound `|∑_{x} χ(x)ψ(f(x))| ≤ C√q` (which would make the Round-9 twisted-sum pieces
unconditional). Its univariate Stepanov proof plugs into this interface with the auxiliary
`Ψ(x) = ∑_{i,j} c_{ij} x^i f(x)^{j(q−1)/m}` (incorporating the multiplicative character via the
polynomial `f(x)^{(q−1)/m}`, whose value is `χ(f(x))` at the rational points) — the remaining work is
that auxiliary's construction and the **non-vanishing argument** (a leading/lowest-term or
`p`-th-power-structure argument), the genuine kernel Mathlib lacks. Note also that the Weil bound
recovers the **Johnson** radius (`√ρ`); pinning `δ*` strictly past Johnson is separately open.

All results are `sorry`-free and axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).

/-- **Order of vanishing from Hasse derivatives (char-`p`-safe).** If `Ψ ≠ 0` and every Hasse
derivative `hasseDeriv k Ψ` of order `k < M` vanishes at `a`, then `a` is a root of `Ψ` of
multiplicity at least `M`. Unlike iterated ordinary derivatives, Hasse derivatives detect the order
of vanishing in every characteristic. -/

auxiliary `Ψ` of degree `< D` whose Hasse derivatives of every order `k < M` vanish at every point of
the candidate set `V`, then `|V|·M < D`. This is the exact entry point a univariate Stepanov

structural non-vanishing); the point-count conclusion is then automatic. -/
