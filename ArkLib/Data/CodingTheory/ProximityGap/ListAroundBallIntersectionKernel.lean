has Hamming norm at least `d`. -/

/-- **(i) Codeword-centered triviality.**  For a code with minimum distance `d`, the list of
codewords within radius `r < d` of a *codeword* `c` is exactly `{c}`.  Equivalently, via the
bijection `c' ↦ c' - c`, the only codeword of weight `< d` is `0`.  This is the precise sense in
which the weight enumerator controls the codeword-centered list only trivially below the
minimum distance `d = n - k + 1 ~ (1-ρ)n`. -/

/-- The Hamming ball of radius `r` around `c`, as a finset of all words (the ambient
`Fin n → F` is finite since `F` is). -/
def hammingBall (c : Fin n → F) (r : ℕ) : Finset (Fin n → F) :=
  Finset.univ.filter (fun w => hammingDist c w ≤ r)

/-- **(ii) Union-bound / count identity (basic).**  For an arbitrary received word `w`, the
radius-`r` list is exactly the set of codewords whose distance to `w` is `≤ r`; hence its
cardinality is the count of such codewords.  This is the union-bound localization: the list size
is a *count over codewords*, controlled by how many codewords land in the ball `B(w,r)`. -/
theorem listAround_card_eq_count (C : Finset (Fin n → F)) (w : Fin n → F) (r : ℕ) :

/-- **(ii) First moment — double counting.**  Summing the list size over *all* received words `w`
equals the total ball mass `∑_{c ∈ C} |B(c,r)|`.  (Each pair `(c, w)` with `dist(w,c) ≤ r` is
counted once on each side.)  This is the elementary identity behind the averaging/covering
argument. -/

/-- The list size as a sum of indicators over codewords. -/
theorem listAround_card_eq_sum_indicator (C : Finset (Fin n → F)) (w : Fin n → F) (r : ℕ) :

/-- **(ii) Second moment = ball-intersection sum (the #82 kernel).**  The sum of *squared* list
sizes over all received words equals the double sum of ball intersections
`∑_{c,c' ∈ C} |B(c,r) ∩ B(c',r)|`.  This identity is exactly why the ball-intersection second
moment is the object controlling list sizes for a *general* (non-codeword) center: by Cauchy–
Schwarz / Paley–Zygmund, a uniform upper bound on `∑_{c,c'} |B(c,r) ∩ B(c',r)|` yields the sharp
list-size control past the Johnson radius.  This double-counting identity is proven here; the
*sharp upper bound on the right-hand side* for explicit RS is the open prize kernel. -/
