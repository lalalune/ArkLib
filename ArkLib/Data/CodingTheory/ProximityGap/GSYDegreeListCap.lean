Round 14 — Angle A: the Y-DEGREE LIST CAP, the algebraic endgame of the
Guruswami–Sudan list-decoding argument (ABF26 / ArkLib #232 context).

Statement: let `F` be a field and `Q : (F[X])[Y]` (encoded as
`Polynomial (Polynomial F)`, outer variable = Y) a NONZERO bivariate polynomial.
If `S` is a finite set of univariate polynomials `f : F[X]` such that
`(Y - C f) ∣ Q` for every `f ∈ S`, then `S.card ≤ Q.natDegree` (= deg_Y Q).

This is exactly the step that converts "every close codeword's polynomial is a
Y-root of the interpolated Q" into the LIST-SIZE bound `|List| ≤ deg_Y Q` in
Guruswami–Sudan.  Proof route: push Q along the injective ring hom
`F[X] → RatFunc F` (coefficientwise); over the field `RatFunc F` each `f ∈ S`
becomes a genuine root of the (still nonzero) image of Q, distinct `f` give
distinct roots by injectivity, and a nonzero polynomial over a field has at
most `natDegree` distinct roots.

Non-vacuity: a concrete instance with `Q = (Y - C X)(Y - C (X+1))` over ℚ and
the two-element root set `S = {X, X+1}` is constructed below, with the cap
attained with equality (2 ≤ 2).

What is NOT proven here: this file does not construct the GS interpolation
polynomial Q, does not relate deg_Y Q to the agreement parameter t and the
weighted degree, and says nothing about pushing past the Johnson radius.  It is
the reusable algebraic cap only.

/-- **Y-degree list cap.**  If `Q ≠ 0` in `(F[X])[Y]` and every `f` in the
finite set `S ⊆ F[X]` gives a linear factor `Y - C f` of `Q`, then
`|S| ≤ deg_Y Q`.  (Here the outer `Polynomial.X` plays the role of `Y`.) -/
