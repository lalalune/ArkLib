# The pointwise representation-count route cannot beat the `8/3` energy exponent (#389)

`GVHBKEnergyReduction.lean` proves, from the Garcia–Voloch pointwise input
`GVRepBound G M` (`∀ t ≠ 0, repCount G t ≤ M`, with `M³ ≤ 64·|G|²` i.e. `M = 4·|G|^{2/3}`),
the energy bound `E(G) ≤ (1+M)·|G|²`, hence `E(G) ≲ |G|^{8/3}`.  The literature
(`HBKEnergySupplyBound.lean`, recorded as a named residual) gives the strictly stronger
`E(G) ≪ |G|^{5/2}` for proper subgroups, and a fresh literature sweep
(`docs/kb/deltastar-literature-findings-2026-06-13.md` §0.A) suggested the `5/2` follows
from "summing the `4·|G|^{2/3}` shifted-intersection bound over all shifts — no cube-root
loss".  **That derivation is invalid**, and this file proves it so, machine-checked.

The obstruction is information-theoretic, not about any particular subgroup (real
multiplicative subgroups genuinely have `E ≈ |G|^{5/2}`, *below* `8/3`).  The point is that
the pointwise hypotheses — `r i ≤ M` and `∑ r = S` (here `S = |G|²`) — are *by themselves*
consistent with an energy proxy `∑ r²` of order `M·S ≈ |G|^{8/3}`.  Concretely the
saturated profile (`S/M` slots at the cap `M`, one remainder slot) realizes

  `M·S − M² ≤ ∑ r² ≤ M·S`        (`pointwise_method_bound_tight`)

so the pointwise upper bound `M·S` is **tight up to an additive `M²` (lower order)**.  Any
energy bound proved using only the pointwise cap and the total mass is therefore `≥ M·S −
M² ≈ 4·|G|^{8/3}`, and cannot reach `|G|^{5/2}` (since `5/2 < 8/3`).  Reaching `5/2`
genuinely requires the deeper second-moment / sum-product input ([SV11] Thm 1.1;
`AddEnergyMulHomogeneous.lean` lands its honest first reduction `E ≪ |G|^{5/2} ⟸
N ≪ |G|^{3/2}`), **not** summing the cap — exactly as `GVHBKEnergyReduction.lean`'s own
docstring (lines 44–46) and `GVRepBoundFromEnergy.lean` ("no elementary proof") already
flag.  A `NoGo` brick in the project's documented-refutation convention.

Axiom-clean (`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`); no `sorry`.

/-- **The pointwise method is tight — the `NoGo` for a sub-`8/3` energy bound from the
pointwise cap alone.**  There is a feasible representation-count profile meeting the
pointwise hypotheses (`r i ≤ M`, `∑ r = S`) whose additive-energy proxy `∑ r²` is pinned to
`M·S` up to an additive `M²`:

  `M·S − M² ≤ ∑ r² ≤ M·S`.

With the Garcia–Voloch cap `M = 4·|G|^{2/3}` and total mass `S = |G|²` the leading term is
`M·S ≈ 4·|G|^{8/3}`, so the pointwise hypothesis is consistent with energy of order
`|G|^{8/3}`.  Hence **no energy bound proved from the pointwise cap and the total mass can
reach `|G|^{5/2}`** (`5/2 < 8/3`); the lit-note §0.A "sum the cap → 5/2" derivation is
invalid.  The genuine `5/2` needs the deeper second-moment input, not this one. -/
