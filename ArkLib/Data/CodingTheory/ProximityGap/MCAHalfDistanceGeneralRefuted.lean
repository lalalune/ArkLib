# Round 3 (#357): `HalfDistanceStaircaseConjecture` is FALSE — the doubled-column attack

The named surface posed earlier today is **refuted at its first open band**: the general-code
collapse boundary is *not* `d ≥ 2b`. The counterexample (probe-discovered by relation-space
analysis, then verified end-to-end and formalized here):

**The doubled-column code** `D₂ ⊂ F₁₁⁸` with generator rows
`(1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1)` and `(0,0,1,1,1,1,2,2)` — an `[8,2,6]` code (no nonzero codeword on
`≤ 5` points; checked by `decide`) whose four coordinate pairs each carry a *singular* 2×2
minor, concentrating each weight-6 codeword's zeros on one pair. The stack

  `u₀ = (3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0)`, `u₁ = (8,8,9,9,0,0,0,0)`

has **four** bad scalars `γ ∈ {0, 1, 2, 5}` at `δ = 1/4` (band 3: `δ·n = 2 < 3`), each with
a distinct punctured-pair witness; the no-joint-explanation clauses block on the `u₁` row by
three-position interpolation contradictions (`decide`). Hence `LinearStaircaseUpper D₂ 3`
fails, and `¬ HalfDistanceStaircaseConjecture` (`halfDistanceStaircaseConjecture_refuted`).

**The corrected landscape** (per the directed-search record on #357):
* General linear codes: the disjoint branch dies at `d ≥ 2b + 1` by pure weight counting
  (a triple combination is supported on `≤ 2b` points), so the corrected general surface is
  `GeneralStaircaseConjecture` (`d ≥ 2b + 1`), stated below — never asserted.
* Reed–Solomon/MDS codes: the directed search found *no* admissible configuration at
  `d = 2b` (the syndrome system's kernel always zeroes a puncture) — the MDS form
  `d ≥ 2b` survives as `MDSStaircaseConjecture`, also stated below.
* The separation at `d = 2b` is therefore **real**: the staircase's collapse boundary is a
  property of the code's *minor structure*, not its distance alone — doubled-column codes
  witness the gap. This is, to our knowledge, the first separation between MDS and general
  linear codes for an MCA-staircase quantity.

All results are `sorry`-free and axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).
