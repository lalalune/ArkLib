# A residual-free Garcia–Voloch instance: `μ_4 ⊆ F_13` (#389)

Companion to `ConcreteWeilInstance` (`μ_6 ⊆ F_37`, `μ_14 ⊆ F_239`).  `μ_4 ⊆ F_13` (the 4th roots of
unity `{1, 5, 8, 12}`, with `5` a primitive 4th root) is exactly Sidon-modulo-negation: its additive
energy is `E = 36 = 3·4² − 3·4`, so `energyExcess = 0`.  Feeding `C = 0` into
`gvRepBound_of_energyExcess_quadratic` gives, with no residual,

> **`mu4_F13_gvRepBound`** — `GVRepBound (μ_4 ⊆ F_13) 4`: every nonzero `t` has at most `4` additive
> representations.

This is the smallest untried even order, in the fastest field, extending the in-tree
`n⁴/p`-energy-scaling sequence of concrete residual-free instances.  Every hypothesis (including the
energy) is discharged by `decide`; axiom-clean (`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`).
