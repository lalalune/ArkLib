ANGLE F — Averaging-crossover hypothesis for the Ethereum Proximity Prize (ABF26, ArkLib #232).

We attack the question of where the list-size threshold δ* lies for smooth-domain
Reed–Solomon codes by formalizing the *averaging lower bound* exactly, as a conservation
law plus a second-moment identity, and stating the sharp hypothesis these support.

Conceptual setup (the "averaging" picture).
  Fix a base index set `ι` of size `n` and a parameter `a` (think `a = k + t`, the support
  size of the codewords we count). Consider all `a`-subsets `S ⊆ ι`. Each such `S` is mapped
  to a `t`-tuple of field elements `Φ S ∈ (Fin t → F)` (think: the `t` "extra evaluation
  constraints" that pin a codeword of an enlarged degree). The *fiber* over a target tuple
  `y` is `{S : Φ S = y}`; its size is the number of `a`-subsets consistent with the
  constraints `y`. The list size at the averaging radius is exactly a max fiber size, and the
  averaging lower bound is `maxList ≥ average = (#a-subsets) / q^t`.

What we prove (all axiom-clean, self-contained over `Mathlib`):

  (1) CONSERVATION LAW (the heart of the averaging bound):
        ∑_{y : Fin t → F} (#fiber over y)  =  (# of a-subsets of ι)  =  C(n, a).
      This is the clean "every a-subset lands in exactly one fiber" identity. Combined with
      the fact that there are exactly `q^t = |F|^t` targets, the *average* fiber size is
      EXACTLY `C(n,a) / q^t`, hence `maxList ≥ C(n,a) / q^t` (a pigeonhole, also proved).

  (2) SECOND-MOMENT / COLLISION IDENTITY:
        ∑_{y} (#fiber over y)²  =  # of *colliding ordered pairs* (S, S') with Φ S = Φ S'.
      This relates the second moment of the fiber distribution to the collision count and is
      what controls how far `maxList` can exceed the `average` (anti-concentration ⇒ max ≈ avg).

  (3) The MAX vs AVERAGE inequalities both directions that these identities yield:
        average ≤ max,   and   q^t · max ≥ ∑ fiber = C(n,a).

THE SHARP HYPOTHESIS (stated as a `Prop`, NOT asserted — we don't claim to prove it):
  δ* = δ_avg := the averaging crossover, iff the fiber distribution is anti-concentrated,
  i.e. maxFiber ≤ Cst · avgFiber. We give the precise `AntiConcentrated` predicate and show
  it is *equivalent* to the averaging bound being tight (max ≈ average up to the constant).

Honest scope: we prove the COMBINATORIAL CONSERVATION + SECOND-MOMENT IDENTITIES exactly, and
the pigeonhole average≤max. We do NOT prove the geometric input that `Φ`-fibers correspond to
RS codewords within radius δ, nor that the field-size corrections vanish, nor that the
anti-concentration hypothesis holds. Those are the open content of the prize. This file
delivers the *exact algebraic backbone* of the averaging lower bound and the precise
hypothesis whose truth would pin δ* = δ_avg.

/-! ### The sharp hypothesis (stated, not asserted) -/

/-- The fiber distribution is `C`-**anti-concentrated** if the maximum fiber is at most `C`
times the average fiber `C(n,a)/q^t`, i.e. `q^t · maxFiber ≤ C · C(n,a)`. When the multiplier
`C` is field-independent (a constant), the averaging lower bound is *tight* and `maxFiber` is
pinned to the average up to that constant. -/
def AntiConcentrated (a : ℕ) (C : ℕ) : Prop :=
  (Fintype.card F) ^ t * maxFiber t Φ a ≤ C * (Fintype.card ι).choose a

/-- **THE SHARP HYPOTHESIS, made precise.** Anti-concentration (with constant `C`) is
*equivalent* to the two-sided pinning `C(n,a) ≤ q^t · maxFiber ≤ C · C(n,a)`. Hence under
anti-concentration, `maxFiber` equals the average `C(n,a)/q^t` up to the field-independent
factor `C`. The prize hypothesis "δ* = δ_avg" is exactly: for the RS-geometric `Φ`, the fiber
is anti-concentrated with a `C` that is `poly`/`2^o(λ)` (not `q^Ω(1)`). -/

section Sanity
/-- With `t = 0` there is a single target (the empty tuple), so the unique fiber is the whole
set of `a`-subsets, fiber count `= C(n,a)`, and the conservation law reads `C(n,a) = C(n,a)`. -/

/-- The collision count is at least `C(n,a)` (every subset collides with itself), confirming the
second-moment identity is not secretly counting zero. -/
