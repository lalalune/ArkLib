# THE LADDER EXACT LIST THEOREM (#389): the subset-sum fibre law at ladder words,
# char-0 core, m = 2

The subset-sum fibre law (issue #389) predicts that sub-Johnson single-word lists on
smooth domains are subset-sum fibres.  This file PROVES its rigidity half, exactly, for
`m = 2` ladder words over 2-power root-of-unity domains in characteristic zero — the
field-independent core layer (the per-prime halo correction is the named O134 surplus):

* `ladder_explainer_fiber` — **rigidity (the fibre law's upper half at ladder words)**:
  every codeword of `rsCode dom k` (`k ≤ 2r−2`) agreeing with the ladder word
  `w(x) = x^{2r} + λ·x^{2r−2}` on `≥ 2r` domain points differs from it by EXACTLY
  `∏_{t∈T}(x² − t)` for an `r`-subset `T` of `μ_{n/2}` with `Σ T = −λ`.
  Chain: the difference `g` is monic of degree `2r` with `2r` distinct roots in `μ_n`
  and vanishing `(2r−1)`-coefficient ⟹ `Σ(roots) = 0` ⟹ the root set is
  **antipodally closed** (the in-tree subset Lam–Leung engine
  `subset_neg_mem_of_sum_zero`) ⟹ squaring is exactly 2-to-1 on it ⟹ `g = G(X²)`
  by the matching-degree difference trick, `T := roots of G`, and the band
  coefficient pins `Σ T = −λ`.
* `exists_dom_eq_of_root` — domain surjectivity onto `μ_n` is automatic for an
  injective `n`-point domain inside `μ_n` (root counting).

Consequences: the single-word list at agreement `≥ 2r` injects into the subset-sum
fibre `{T ⊆ μ_{n/2} : |T| = r, ΣT = −λ}` — the conjectured value `N_fib` is an upper
bound, as a theorem, at every dimension `k ≤ 2r−2` (for `k < 2r−3` the formula plus
membership forces the additional census vanishing `e_j(T) = 0`, cutting the class
further, exactly as the gap-census law predicts).  Agreement is self-capped at `2r`
(the difference has degree `2r`), so this is the complete list law at these words.
The supply (lower) half in the regime `2r−3 ≤ k` is the fibre-family construction
(`w − ∏(x²−t)` has degree `≤ 2r−4 < k` when `ΣT = −λ`), registered next.
Issue #389; fibre-law conjecture comment; O134 (per-prime surplus) is the named
obstruction to a verbatim finite-field lift, as the protocol red-team note records.
