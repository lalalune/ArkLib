# In-window saturation: the first unconditional exact `ε_mca` value inside the window
# for a smooth-domain RS code

For `RS[F₁₇, μ₈, 2]` (the smooth domain `μ₈ = ⟨2⟩`, rate `ρ = 1/4`, Johnson radius
`1/2`, capacity `3/4`) at the in-window grid radius `δ = 5/8 ∈ (1/2, 3/4)`:

  **`ε_mca(C, 5/8) = 1` exactly** (`epsMCA_window_saturates`).

The lower half is fully explicit: the monomial pair `(X⁴, X²)` is MCA-bad at **every**
scalar `λ ∈ F₁₇` — seventeen kernel-checked certificates (`event_of_cert` + the table),
each a 3-point witness with an affine explanation of the line and one row affinely
inexplicable there. The upper half is trivial (`Pr ≤ 1`).

**What this is.** The small-field saturation phenomenon — measured by the O139 probes
("the `a = k+1` window row saturates the field"), consumed as folklore in every
"the prize must fix `|F|` large" remark — as a two-sided theorem at a genuine smooth
instance, strictly inside the open Johnson–capacity window. Companion to the sibling's
`mcaDeltaStar_window_interior_eq` (the `F₁₁` interior pin on a *non-smooth* domain):
this is the smooth-domain side of the boundary map.

Ledger corollary (`mcaDeltaStar_le_of_window_saturation`): for **every** target
`ε* < 1` — in particular any cryptographic target — this smooth code's threshold is
capped mid-window: `δ*(C, ε*) ≤ 5/8`, unconditionally.

All results are `sorry`-free and axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).
