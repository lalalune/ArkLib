# An EXACT in-window supply ZERO: the cubic word on the NTT domain `μ_16 ⊂ F₂₅₇` (#389)

The cubic orchard identity (`cubic_list_eq_zeroSum`, in-tree) is exact: for `w = x³` on
any domain `dom : Fin n ↪ F`, the number of `rsCode dom 2` codewords with agreement `≥ 3`
(the explainable-`3`-core supply, the deepest pre-capacity band `m = 0` for `k = 2`)
equals the number of `3`-subsets of the domain summing to `0`.

This file instantiates it at the production-shape NTT domain `μ_16 ⊆ F₂₅₇^×` (the order-16
multiplicative subgroup; `F₂₅₇` is the canonical small NTT field).  The zero-sum-triple
count there is **exactly `0`** — the char-`0` Mann rigidity (three `2`-power roots of unity
never sum to zero, as `μ_{2^k}` contains no cube root of unity) **survives to `F₂₅₇`** —
so:

> **`cubicSupply_mu16_F257_eq_zero`** — the cubic word `x³` on `μ_16 ⊂ F₂₅₇` has
> **exactly `0`** explainable `3`-cores: NO degree-`<2` codeword agrees with it on `3`
> points.

This is the first **exact, machine-checked, in-window supply ZERO** at a production NTT
domain: at radius `δ = 1 − 3/16 = 13/16`, one granularity step below the capacity radius
`14/16` (i.e. deep in the prize window `(1−√ρ, 1−ρ)`), the cubic word contributes *no*
bad scalars at all — far below both the random mean `C(16,3)/q ≈ 2.2` and the GV ceiling
`√(16·E(μ_16)) = √(16·912) ≈ 121` from `gvRepBound_H16`.  It is a concrete witness that
the smooth-domain supply can sit at the *bottom* of its two-regime band (`Θ(n)` floor →
here `0`), the regime the δ* lower bound needs.

Contrast (the wall): over the FULL field `F₂₅₇` the same cubic word has `Θ(q²)` explainable
cores (`sumZero_card_quadratic`), and on the worst `μ_{2^k} ⊂ F_p` the count reaches
`~n^{5/3}` (`probe_smooth_zero_sum_triples.py`) — the smooth multiplicative structure is
exactly what collapses it here.
