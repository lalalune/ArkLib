# Round 8 (Issue #232, ABF26) — the COSET WALL: why the algebraic concentration is super-polynomial
# only near capacity, and merely polynomial in the deep interior.

The coset construction (`Round8CosetConcentration.lean`) produces a list of RS codewords as unions of
`r` cosets of an order-`N` subgroup of the smooth evaluation domain (`|domain| = n`, rate `ρ = k/n`).
Killing the top `t` power sums — required for a degree drop at agreement `a = k + t`, i.e. radius
`δ = 1 − a/n` — needs the coset size to satisfy `N ≥ t + 1` (a coset of `N`-th roots of unity kills
`p₁, …, p_{N−1}`). A union of `r` cosets has size `a = r·N`, and the number of such unions is
`C(M, r)` with `M = n / N` the number of cosets.

This file formalizes, as clean self-contained `Nat` inequalities, **why `C(M, r)` is super-polynomial
only very close to capacity** (`t` small, so `r` large) **and merely polynomial deeper in the
interior** (`t` a constant fraction of `k`, so `r = O(1)`). This is honest "wall" cartography: it
proves the algebraic route provably cannot pin `δ*` at constant-fraction interior depth — matching the
[ABF26] assessment that the deep interior has "no known technique".

* `count_poly_and_budget` — the cap `C(M,r) ≤ Mʳ` together with the budget `r·(t+1) ≤ a`. As `t` grows
  the exponent `r ≤ a/(t+1)` shrinks: at `t ≥ k` the count is essentially linear (`budget_forces_r_le_one`
  gives `r ≤ 1`).
* `two_pow_le_choose_count` — the contrast `2ʳ ≤ C(M, r)` for `2r ≤ M`: near capacity (`t` small, `r`
  large) the count genuinely blows up super-polynomially, so the polynomial cap is non-vacuous.

All results are `sorry`-free and axiom-clean.

/-- **Lemma A (polynomial cap).** The number of coset-unions `C(M, r)` is at most `M ^ r` —
polynomial in `M` for fixed `r`. -/

/-- **Lemma B (budget forces small `r` at deep interior).** If the coset is big enough to kill `t`
power sums (`N ≥ t + 1`), the union size equals the agreement (`r·N = a`), the agreement is
`a = k + t`, and we are at constant-fraction-or-deeper interior (`t ≥ k`), then the number of cosets
in the union is `r ≤ 1`.

Proof: `r·(t+1) ≤ r·N = a = k + t ≤ 2t < 2·(t+1)`, so `r < 2`. -/

/-- **Lemma C (general polynomial bound).** Combining the polynomial cap with the coset budget: the
count is at most `M ^ r`, and the number of cosets satisfies `r·(t+1) ≤ a` (i.e. `r ≤ a/(t+1)`). As
`t` grows (deeper interior), the exponent `r` shrinks and `M ^ r` collapses toward polynomial. -/

/-- Helper for Lemma D: `2 ^ r ≤ C(M, r)` whenever `2r ≤ M`. Route:
`2ʳ ≤ centralBinom r = C(2r, r) ≤ C(M, r)` by monotonicity of `choose` in the top argument. -/

/-- **Lemma D (near-capacity super-poly — the contrast).** When the number of cosets in a union `r` is
at most half the total number of cosets `M` (`2r ≤ M`, available only *very close to capacity*, where
`t` is small so `r = a/N` can be large), the count is at least `2 ^ r` — super-polynomial in `r`. This
witnesses that the polynomial cap of Lemma A/C is non-vacuous: the count genuinely blows up near
capacity, and only the budget `r·(t+1) ≤ a` of Lemma C tames it in the interior. -/
