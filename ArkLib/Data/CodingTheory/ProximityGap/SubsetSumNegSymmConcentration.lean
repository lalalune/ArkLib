# Round 7 (Issue #232, ABF26) — a CONCENTRATION construction: negation-symmetric subsets force the
# window sum `e_1 = ∑ x` to a *single* target `0`, with a field-independent super-polynomial count.

Round 6 sharply localized the open core of the §7 list-decoding disproof to two coupled questions
about the `(SUM, SUM-OF-SQUARES)` count
`N2(a; c₁,c₂) := #{ a-subsets S of the smooth 2^k-subgroup G : ∑_{x∈S} x = c₁ ∧ ∑_{x∈S} x² = c₁²−2c₂ }`
(`twoSymmetric_count_eq_e1_psum2_count`):

* a super-polynomial **lower** bound (fitting `|F| < 2^256`) would pin `δ*` from below in the deep
  interior (the disproof);
* the prize itself needs the list `|Λ| ≤ ε*·q` for a *fixed* `ε*`, which Round 6
  (`ListInteriorQDependenceNoGo`) proved is **equivalent** to the count *concentrating* on `O(1)`
  targets — the averaging/pigeonhole method provably loses a factor `/q`. A prize counterexample
  therefore needs a construction whose count **concentrates on few targets** — the OPEN DOOR.

## What this round contributes: direct concentration of the FIRST coordinate `e_1`

This file attacks the open door head-on with the **negation-symmetric** construction. A smooth
`2^k`-subgroup `G` is closed under negation (`−1 = ζ^{n/2} ∈ G`); pick a transversal `H` of the
`±`-pairs, so `G = H ⊔ (−H)` disjointly with `|H| = n/2`. For any `P ⊆ H`, the **negation-symmetric**
subset `P ∪ (−P)` has size `2|P|` and — because its elements pair up as `x, −x` (genuinely distinct
when `char F ≠ 2`, which holds automatically: a `2^k`-subgroup needs `|F|` odd) — window sum

  `∑_{x ∈ P ∪ (−P)} x = 0`   (`negSymm_sum_eq_zero`, via `Finset.sum_involution`).

So **every** subset in this family lands in the *single* `e_1 = 0` fiber: the first coordinate is
**concentrated at one target**, with **no `/q` loss**. The map `P ↦ P ∪ (−P)` is injective, so the
`e_1 = 0` fiber at agreement `2t` has size

  `C(n/2, t)  ≤  #{ S ⊆ G : |S| = 2t,  ∑_{x∈S} x = 0 }`   (`subsetSumCount_zero_ge_choose_half`).

This is a **field-independent, super-polynomial** lower bound on a *single* subset-sum fiber `c₁ = 0`
— it **beats the averaging floor** `C(n,2t)/q` on the `e_1` coordinate (the averaging method only
delivers `C(n,2t)/q` at the heavy target; here the *fixed* target `0` already carries `C(n/2,t)`,
`q`-independently). This is exactly the kind of `q`-independent single-fiber bound the prize needs,
*on the first of the two coordinates*.

## Honest scope — the `e_2`/`p_2` coordinate still spreads (the door is opened, not walked through)

The construction concentrates `e_1` but **does not** by itself concentrate the second coordinate. For
a negation-symmetric `S = P ∪ (−P)`, the sum of squares is

  `∑_{x∈S} x² = ∑_{g∈P} (g² + (−g)²) = 2·∑_{g∈P} g²`   (`negSymm_psum2_eq_two_mul`),

so `p_2(S)` ranges over `2·(sum of t pair-squares {g² : g ∈ H})`. We formalize this exactly. Whether
*this* spreads over `q` targets or concentrates is governed by the **additive span of the pair-square
set `{g² : g ∈ H}`** — a genuinely new, *additive*-combinatorial sub-question on the squares of a
subgroup transversal. We are honest: this file proves the `e_1`-concentration is real,
super-polynomial, and `q`-independent, and reduces the *remaining* prize gap to the
**second-coordinate** spread `#{ t-subsets P of H : ∑_{g∈P} g² = c }` — i.e. whether the pair-squares
have small additive span. That second sub-question is **open** and is NOT resolved here; what is new
is that the first coordinate is now *provably* concentrated and the prize gap is localized entirely to
the sum-of-squares spread.

What this is and is NOT:
* It **IS** a genuine, `sorry`-free, axiom-clean construction giving a `q`-independent
  super-polynomial lower bound `C(n/2,t)` on the *single* `e_1 = 0` subset-sum fiber — a real crack
  at the concentration door on the first coordinate.
* It is **NOT** a prize counterexample: the second coordinate `p_2 = 2∑g²` still spreads unless the
  pair-squares `{g²}` have small additive span, which remains open. We localize, we do not close.

All headline results are `sorry`-free and axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).

then `∑_{x∈S} x = 0`. The negation map `x ↦ −x` is an involution on `S` (it maps `S` into itself by

and `char F ≠ 2` (`neg_ne_self_of_ne_zero`). `Finset.sum_involution` then collapses the sum to `0`.

Consequence: **every** negation-symmetric set of nonzero elements lands in the single window-sum
target `0`. The first coordinate `e_1 = ∑ x` is concentrated at one value — no averaging `/q` loss. -/

/-! ## 5. The headline: a field-independent, `q`-independent count `C(|H|,t)` in the single `e_1=0`
fiber. -/

/-- **`C(|H|, t)` negation-symmetric subsets of size `2t`, ALL in the single `e_1 = 0` fiber.** Let
`(2 : F) ≠ 0`, `H` a transversal of the `±`-pairs (`Disjoint H (H.image (−·))`) with `0 ∉ H`. Then
the `t`-subsets `P ⊆ H` inject (via `P ↦ negClosure P = P ∪ (−P)`) into the size-`2t` subsets with
window sum `0`. Hence

  `C(|H|, t)  ≤  #{ S ⊆ G : |S| = 2t, ∑_{x∈S} x = 0 }`     (here counted inside `H ∪ (−H)`).

The right-hand count is a **single** subset-sum fiber (`target = 0`), so this is a *concentrated*,
field-independent, `q`-independent lower bound — it does not lose the `/q` the averaging method
incurs. With `|H| = n/2` and `t` fixed, `C(n/2, t)` is super-polynomial in `n`. -/

appearance of `q = |F|`. So unlike the averaging heavy-fiber bound `max_target N(2t, target) ≥
C(n,2t)/q` (which is `q`-dependent and at an *unknown* target), this concentration bound pins the
**known** target `0` to a `q`-independent value. This is the structural feature Round 6's
`ListInteriorQDependenceNoGo` identified as necessary for a prize counterexample — delivered here on
the first of the two coordinates. We record the `q`-independence as the plain statement that the
bound has no `q` factor. -/
