# The mean-degree law is FALSE below Johnson at `q = Θ(n)` (#389, countermodel)

The issue-thread conjecture (`MeanDegreeLaw`): every word's capped large-agreement
family satisfies `Σ_c a_c ≤ 2n`.  Above Johnson it is a theorem
(`meanDegreeLaw_above_johnson`).  This file refutes it below Johnson:

> **`meanDegreeLaw_subJohnson_REFUTED`** — at `q = n = 19`, `k = 2`, `t = 4`,
> `cap = 6` (band `m = 1`, `t² = 16 < 38 = 2(k−1)n`, strictly sub-Johnson): an
> explicit word `w` and ten explicit lines, each agreeing with `w` on `4` or `5`
> points, with `Σ a_c = 41 > 38 = 2n`.

> **`w19_globally_capped`** — the countermodel word is GLOBALLY capped: every
> codeword of `rsCode dom19 2` (all `19²` lines) agrees with `w` on `≤ 5 ≤ cap`
> points, so the violation is not an artifact of family selection.

**Why the census missed it**: the first moment.  A *random* word over the full
domain `n = q` has `≈ q²·C(n,t)/qᵗ` lines of agreement `≥ t`, giving
`Σ a_c ≈ t·C(n,t)/q^{t−2} = Θ(n²)` at `q = Θ(n)`, fixed `t` — the quadratic
set-system optimum is realized by RANDOM words once `n³ ≳ t!·q²`.  The census
probes (`n ≤ 20`, `q = 31`) sat just below that visibility threshold.  The law is
a `q ≫ n^{(t−1)/(t−2)}` phenomenon, not a universal one; at production scaling
`q = Θ(n)` the sub-Johnson supply target must be the supply `Σ_c C(a_c, t)`
itself (which stays polynomial for random words — the open content is adversarial
*concentration*, the class-structure bound), NOT the linear mean-degree law.

**Relation to the Frobenius/subplane refutations** (`FrobeniusSubfieldBlowup.lean`,
`SubplaneSupplyFloor.lean`, same day): those realize the blowup through subfield
structure (`𝔽_p`-affine-closed domains, secants of the Frobenius graph) and conclude
the mechanism "needs a proper subfield".  This countermodel shows the MASS law needs
no structure at all: `q = 19` is PRIME, the domain is the full affine line (no proper
subfield, no additive subspace), the word is random, the band is the production shape
`(k, m) = (2, 1)`.  Counting alone kills the mass law at `q = Θ(n)`; only the SUPPLY
law (`Σ_c C(a_c,t)`, which the Frobenius word makes quadratic but a random word keeps
polynomial) is domain-coupled.
