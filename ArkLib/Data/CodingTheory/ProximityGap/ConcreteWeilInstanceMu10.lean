# A residual-free Garcia–Voloch instance at `n = 10`: `μ_10 ⊆ F_31` (#389)

Fills the order-10 entry of the concrete residual-free sequence (`μ_4 ⊆ F_13`, `μ_6 ⊆ F_37`,
`μ_8 ⊆ F_41`, `μ_10 ⊆ F_31`, `μ_12 ⊆ F_37`, `μ_14 ⊆ F_239`).  `μ_10 ⊆ F_31` (the 10th roots of
unity, `−2` a primitive 10th root since `(−2)^5 = −1`) has additive energy `E = 390`; the
Sidon-modulo-negation value is `3·10² − 3·10 = 270`, so `energyExcess = 120` and (since
`120 ≤ 2·10²`) the general `C = 2` branch of `gvRepBound_of_energyExcess_quadratic` fires:

> **`mu10_F31_gvRepBound`** — `GVRepBound (μ_10 ⊆ F_31) 8`: every nonzero `t` has at most `8`
> additive representations (`(3+2)·10 = 50 ≤ 8² = 64`, `8³ = 512 ≤ 64·10² = 6400`).

The concrete excess sequence is now `μ_4:0, μ_6:0, μ_8:32 (C=1), μ_10:120 (C=2), μ_12:288 (C=2),
μ_14:168 (C=1)`.  Every hypothesis (including the energy `E = 390`) is discharged by `decide`;
axiom-clean.
