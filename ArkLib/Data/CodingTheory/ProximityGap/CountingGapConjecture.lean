# The counting question in the unpinned window: refuted top slice, surviving interior (#232)

O84 (`TheoremQUDExtraction.lean`) left exactly one unpinned window for the bad-scalar count
on the unique-decoding side: in `e`-units (`e = n − t`, `t = ⌈(1−δ)n⌉₊`), the regime
`3e ≥ d` (the affine-subtraction proof is unavailable) and `2e ≤ d − 1` (unique decoding
still holds), with the **natural conjecture** `mcaBadCount ≤ 2(n−t)+1` open there — "the
gap is a counting question, not a structure question".

`scripts/probes/probe_counting_gap.py` (exact GF(p) arithmetic, exit 0) settles the shape
of the answer:

* **The natural conjecture is FALSE on the top slice `2e = d − 1` (d odd).**  A
  multi-family Möbius construction (error pair `(e₀,e₁)` supported on an `(e+1)`-set `T₁`,
  equal on `T₁` to codeword pairs `h_j` vanishing off `T₁ ∪ T_j`; each family contributes
  `e+1` cancellation scalars with Möbius-distinct ratios) produces
  `badCount = 6 > 5 = 2e+1` at RS(6,2)/GF(7) (`δ = 1/3`), `10 > 9` at RS(16,8)/GF(97)
  (`δ = 1/4` — inside the δ-window `(d/(3n), (d−1)/(2n)]`, at its included right
  endpoint) and at RS(12,4)/GF(13), and `12 > 3` at RS(12,10)/GF(13) (`e = 1, d = 3`:
  twelve of thirteen scalars bad — **no closed form `f(e)` or `f(n−t)` alone can hold**;
  the count is governed by the m=2-interleaved list size at radius `2e`, the O74/O85
  ceiling `1 + 2(n−t)·Λ₂`).
* **Exhaustively, the top-slice maximum is exactly `2e+2` at the two smallest points**:
  over *all* coset-pair classes of RS(6,2) and RS(7,3) over GF(7) (23,200 affine classes
  each, coverage and invariances machine-checked), the true max badCount is `6 = 2e+2`,
  attained by 20 resp. 140 classes; never `7 = q`.
* **The interior `2e ≤ d − 2` SURVIVES**: 0 violations of `2(n−t)+1` across 1,263
  adversarial stacks (g-planting, 2-g nesting, two-cancel, random, structured-collapse
  shapes) at `(q,n,k,e)` = (97,16,8,3), (13,12,4,3), (13,12,2,4), the even-`d` top
  (13,9,4,2), and a non-MDS (hence non-GRS) `[8,3,5]₇` control; the multi-family
  construction is provably rigid there (the consistency kernel is 1-dimensional, forcing
  proportional rows and a constant ratio — printed by the probe as it blocks).

This file records that split as named statements:

* `GapCountingBoundFullWindow` — the natural conjecture on the **full** UD-side window
  `2(n−t)+1 ≤ d`.  **Expected FALSE** (probe counterexamples above); kept as the named
  falsified surface, not an axiom and never assumed.
* `InteriorCountingBound` — the **surviving** conjecture, window `2(n−t)+2 ≤ d`.  Open;
  every adversarial hunt is consistent with it, and it strictly extends O84's proven
  window `3(n−t) < d` (`interior_window_extends_proven`).
* `interiorCountingBound_of_gapCountingBoundFullWindow` — the (refuted ⇒ surviving)
  monotonicity, so any future proof attempt targets the weaker honest statement.
* `epsMCA_le_of_interiorCountingBound` — the consumer: the surviving conjecture yields
  `ε_mca ≤ (2(n−t)+1)/|F|` on its window, the ABF26 Grand-Challenge `poly/q` shape, via
  `epsMCA_le_of_badCount_le`.
* `gap_trichotomy` / `top_slice_iff_odd` — the e-units bookkeeping: the UD side splits
  exactly into O84's proven window, the surviving interior, and the refuted odd-`d` top
  slice.

Provenance: axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`), zero `sorry`.

/-- **The natural counting conjecture on the full unique-decoding-side window — expected
FALSE.**  For every `F`-linearly-closed code of minimum distance `≥ d` and every stack,
if `2(n−t)+1 ≤ d` (unique decoding) then `mcaBadCount ≤ 2(n−t)+1`.

`probe_counting_gap.py` refutes this for `(ι, F) = (Fin 6, ZMod 7)` at `δ = 1/3`
(badCount `6 > 5`; exhaustive over all stacks, max exactly `6`), for
`(Fin 16, ZMod 97)` at `δ = 1/4` (`10 > 9`), and catastrophically for
`(Fin 12, ZMod 13)` at `δ = 1/12, d = 3` (`12 > 3`).  Named so the falsified surface has
one canonical statement; do **not** cite as a hypothesis — use `InteriorCountingBound`. -/

/-- **The surviving counting conjecture (OPEN): the strict interior of the
unique-decoding side.**  Same bound, on the window `2(n−t)+2 ≤ d` — i.e. strictly below
the unique-decoding radius, `δ`-units `δ < (d−1)/(2n)` away from the included right
endpoint.  `probe_counting_gap.py`: 0 violations across 1,263 adversarial stacks at four
RS parameter points plus a non-MDS (non-GRS) `[8,3,5]₇` attack-search control, and the
only known violation mechanism (coexisting
`(e+1)`-support decode families) is provably unavailable here, since two such families
differ by an interleaved codeword of column weight `≤ 2(n−t)+2 ≤ d`, forcing equality
except on the refuted top slice. -/
