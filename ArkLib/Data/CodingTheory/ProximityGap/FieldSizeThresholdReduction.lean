# The field-size lever for the deployed δ* pin (#389)

The deployed-regime reduction `interiorCeiling_of_censusDomination` consumes a census bound `K`
through the hypothesis `(K : ℝ≥0∞)/p ≤ ε*`. This file isolates the **field-size dependence** of
that hypothesis as a machine-checked theorem: a census bound `K` that is **independent of the
field size** `p` (the only kind the curve-sparsity / additive-energy routes produce — those bound
the list by a function of `n` alone) discharges the obligation **for every field with
`p ≥ K · D`**, where `D = 1/ε*` (`= 2^{128}` at the prize budget).

> **`censusDomination_pin_largeField`** — if `ε* = D⁻¹`, `K · D ≤ p`, and
> `CensusDomination` holds with the `n`-only bound `K`, then `InteriorCeiling` holds, hence the
> pin `δ* = 1 − r/2^μ`.

**Why this matters for the prize (see `docs/kb/deltastar-prize-regime-reduction-2026-06-13.md`).**
The open core is the census/list bound `K`. The Mérai–Shparlinski curve-sparsity route would give
a `q`-independent `K ≈ n^{3/2}`; the additive-energy route targets `K ≈ n`. This theorem says: the
*larger* the field, the *weaker* the list bound that suffices — at `p ≈ n·2^{128}` (deployed) one
needs `K ≲ n` (the sharp `n^{2+o(1)}` energy), but at `p ≳ n^{3/2}·2^{128}` an `n^{3/2}` list bound
already closes the window. It cleanly separates the prize by field size and turns the informal
"large field ⇒ weaker requirement" into a proven reduction; the residual is exactly the
`n`-only census bound `K`, nothing else.

Axiom-clean (`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`); no `sorry`.

/-- **The field-size lever.** A field-size-independent census bound `K` discharges the interior
ceiling for every field large enough that `K · D ≤ p`, where `ε* = D⁻¹`. So the list/census bound
needed to pin `δ* = 1 − r/2^μ` weakens as the field grows: `K ≤ p/D = p·ε*`. -/
