# Line decoding (ABF26 §4.4)

Line decoding is a structural strengthening of list decoding that lifts a fiberwise
"line is close to *some* codeword" statement into an aligned "line is close to a *single*
affine pair `u₁ + γ·u₂`". Definition 4.20 of *Open Problems in List Decoding and Correlated
Agreement* (Arnon, Boneh, Fenzi; April 8, 2026) formalises this; the immediate downstream
fact is Theorem 4.21, which converts a line-decoding bound into a mutual correlated
agreement (MCA) bound.

## Main definitions

- `CodingTheory.LineDecodable` — ABF26 Definition 4.20: `(δ, a, b)`-line-decodability of
  an `F`-additive code `C`.

## Main statements

- `CodingTheory.lineDecodable_imp_epsMCA_le` — ABF26 Theorem 4.21 [GG25 Thm 3.5]:
  `(δ, a, n+1)`-line-decodability gives an MCA bound `ε_mca(C, δ) ≤ a / |F|`.
  Admitted as an external result; the proof in GG25 routes through the line-decoder's
  alignment guarantee and a `Δ_S = 0`-witness argument.

/-- **ABF26 Definition 4.20 [GG25 Def 3.1].** A code `C ⊆ A^ι` is `(δ, a, b)`-**line-decodable**
when every `γ`-indexed family of codewords that aligns with a random line `f₁ + γ·f₂` on at
least an `a/|F|` fraction of `γ`'s is itself induced (on at least a `b/|F|` fraction of `γ`'s)
by a single affine pair `(u₁, u₂)` of codewords.

In formula:

  `∀ f₁ f₂ : ι → A, ∀ U : F → ι → A, (∀ γ, U γ ∈ C) →`
  `  Pr_γ [δᵣ(f₁ + γ • f₂, U γ) ≤ δ] ≥ a / |F| →`
  `  ∃ u₁ u₂ ∈ C, Pr_γ [U γ = u₁ + γ • u₂] ≥ b / |F|`

The hypothesis pins each `U γ` inside `C`; ABF26 writes this as `U : F → C` but Lean is
cleaner with a function into the ambient space plus a side condition. The probabilities
are read in `ENNReal`, matching the convention in
[`ProximityGap.EpsilonErrors`](ProximityGap/EpsilonErrors.lean). -/

/-- **ABF26 Theorem 4.21 [GG25 Thm 3.5].** If `C` is `(δ, a, n+1)`-line-decodable, then its
mutual correlated agreement error is bounded by `a / |F|`:

  `LineDecodable (F := F) C δ a (n+1) → ε_mca(C, δ) ≤ a / |F|`

where `n = |ι|`. The proof in [GG25] proceeds by taking the line-decoder's witness
pair `(u₁, u₂)` and showing that the `Δ_S = 0` witness set of the MCA event must coincide
with the `γ`-set on which `U γ = u₁ + γ • u₂`, which has measure `≥ (n+1)/|F|`. Because
that pair has at most `n` exceptional positions on every fold, the alignment lifts to a
joint-pair witness, contradicting the `¬ pairJointAgreesOn` clause of `mcaEvent` when the
fraction of γ-aligned points exceeds `n/|F|`.
