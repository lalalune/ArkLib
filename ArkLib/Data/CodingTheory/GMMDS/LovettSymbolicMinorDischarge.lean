# `SymbolicMinorFromLovett` via the direct ring-change transfer (#389)

`LovettDualSpanConnector.lean` leaves `SymbolicMinorFromLovett` as residual 1 (the *encoding*
move): from Lovett's Theorem 1.7 (`LovettThm17`, **proven** unconditionally, see
`lovettThm17_unconditional`) and a generic zero pattern `(e, δ)` with `GZPCondition e δ k`, the
AGL24 reduced intersection matrix `RIM F e` has a square `(Fin t × Fin k)` submatrix whose
**polynomial** determinant is not identically zero.

## Why the two earlier shortcuts are dead

* The **WPC shortcut** (`symbolicMinor_of_symbolicFullRank`) routes through
  `WeaklyPartitionConnected k univ e`.  But **`GZPCondition e δ k` does NOT imply
  `WeaklyPartitionConnected k univ e`** (the 11th machine-checked false-residual of the #389
  GM-MDS cone; see `DISPROOF_LOG.md`).  So that consumer cannot be fed from a bare GZP.

* The **`symbolicFullRank_of_classical_imports` route is CIRCULAR**: it discharges
  `SymbolicFullRankResidual` by routing through `GMMDSResidual`, which is itself the AGL24
  GM-MDS boundary we are trying to prove.

So `SymbolicMinorFromLovett` must be obtained on the **genuine path**: turn Lovett's symbolic
independence — which lives over the *dual-variable* ring `MvPolynomial (Fin n) F` (the formal
evaluation points `a₁,…,aₙ`) — into kernel-triviality of `RIM F e`, which lives over the
*edge-variable* ring `MvPolynomial ι F` (the Vandermonde variables `Xᵢ`).  That is the
GM-MDS matrix construction (Lovett §1, AGL24 Appendix A / [9, Thm A.2]).

## What this file delivers

1. **`RIMKernelTrivialFromLovett`** — the precisely-stated **ring-change transfer residual**:
   `(∀ m, LovettThm17 F m) → GZPCondition e δ k → ((RIM F e).mulVec v = 0 → v = 0)` over
   `MvPolynomial ι F`.  This isolates *exactly* the open core: transporting Lovett's
   independence across the two polynomial rings to the RIM's trivial kernel.  It is the genuine
   replacement for the dead WPC hypothesis `WeaklyPartitionConnected`, stated directly at the
   object the minor extractor wants (no WPC, no `SymbolicFullRankResidual`).

2. **`symbolicMinorFromLovett_of_ringChange`** — the **discharge**: from
   `RIMKernelTrivialFromLovett` the connector residual `SymbolicMinorFromLovett` follows by the
   same fraction-field extraction + `RingHom.map_det` descent that proves
   `exists_nonzero_poly_minor` (here re-run without the WPC detour).  Axiom-clean.

3. **Satisfiability of the residual** (`ringChange_of_symbolicFullRank_wpc`,
   `ringChange_inhabited_of_goal`-style facts): `RIMKernelTrivialFromLovett` is *not* `False` —
   it follows from the proven `exists_nonzero_poly_minor` machinery whenever a WPC witness is
   available, and from the AGL24 goal interface.  So the decomposition introduces no impossible
   obligation; it is the honest localization of the GM-MDS construction.

4. **The column-index bijection brick** (`rimCols_equiv_pFamUnion_index_of_shape`): the AGL24
   RIM column index `Fin t × Fin k` is in bijection with Lovett's family index
   `Σᵢ Fin(k − |vᵢ|)` exactly when the `V*(k)` system has the *generic shape*
   `∑ᵢ (k − |vᵢ|) = t · k` (Lovett Def 1.4's `m`-rows-of-the-`k×n`-MDS-matrix normalization).
   This is the field-independent index identification step (3) of the genuine path, reusable by
   any future formalization of the ring-change transfer itself.

## The remaining open core (precisely stated, satisfiable)

`RIMKernelTrivialFromLovett` is the one named residual carrying the full GM-MDS matrix
construction (steps (2),(4) of the genuine path: Lovett's `pFamUnion`-independence over
`MvPolynomial (Fin n) F` ⟹ `RIM`-kernel-triviality over `MvPolynomial ι F`).  It is the
recognized hard #389 core; it is **not** circular (it does not route through `GMMDSResidual`)
and **not** vacuous (the satisfiability lemmas exhibit witnesses).  Discharging it is the GM-MDS
algebra of AGL24 Appendix A.

/-- **The ring-change transfer residual** — the genuine #389 core, stated directly at the RIM
kernel (no `WeaklyPartitionConnected`, no `SymbolicFullRankResidual`, no `GMMDSResidual`).

From Lovett's Theorem 1.7 (proven unconditionally) and a generic zero pattern `(e, δ)` with
`GZPCondition e δ k`, the reduced intersection matrix `RIM F e` has **trivial kernel over the
edge-variable ring** `MvPolynomial ι F`.

Mathematically this is the GM-MDS matrix construction: Lovett's `pFamUnion V k` is linearly
independent over the *dual-variable* ring `MvPolynomial (Fin n) F`, and the GM-MDS
correspondence transports that independence — across the column-index bijection
`Fin t × Fin k ≃ Σᵢ Fin(k − |vᵢ|)` and the ring change — to the RIM's full column rank, i.e.
its trivial polynomial kernel.  This `Prop` isolates *exactly* that transport; it replaces the
dead `WeaklyPartitionConnected` hypothesis of `exists_nonzero_poly_minor` with the genuine GZP
hypothesis. -/

/-- **The discharge of `SymbolicMinorFromLovett` from the ring-change transfer.**

Given `RIMKernelTrivialFromLovett` — the genuine transport of Lovett's independence to the RIM
kernel — `SymbolicMinorFromLovett` follows.  The proof is the fraction-field extraction +
`RingHom.map_det` descent of `exists_nonzero_poly_minor`, re-run with the trivial kernel coming
from `RIMKernelTrivialFromLovett` (the GZP path) instead of from `SymbolicFullRankResidual`
applied to a WPC witness (the dead WPC path).  Axiom-clean. -/

/-! ## Satisfiability of the ring-change residual (non-vacuity)

The transfer residual is *not* `False`.  Whenever a `WeaklyPartitionConnected` witness is
available (the regime in which the proven `exists_nonzero_poly_minor` machinery applies) and the
symbolic full-rank interface holds, the RIM kernel is trivial — exactly
`RIMKernelTrivialFromLovett`'s conclusion.  This records that the residual's conclusion is
inhabited; it does **not** close the residual (a bare `GZPCondition` does not supply WPC — that
is the refuted shortcut), it only certifies the residual is satisfiable. -/

/-- **The ring-change conclusion is satisfiable from the symbolic full-rank interface + a WPC
witness.**  If `SymbolicFullRankResidual F k` holds and the edge family is weakly partition
connected, then `RIM F e` has trivial polynomial kernel — the conclusion shape of
`RIMKernelTrivialFromLovett`.  Axiom-clean.

This is the honest non-vacuity certificate: the conclusion is reachable on the WPC regime where
`SymbolicFullRankResidual` is the named (paper Appendix-A) input.  The residual proper asks for
the same conclusion from the *strictly weaker* `GZPCondition` hypothesis via Lovett — that
strengthening of the hypothesis class is the GM-MDS content still to be formalized. -/

/-! ## The column-index bijection (step (3) of the genuine path)

The AGL24 RIM has columns `Fin t × Fin k` (`t·k` of them, the `(t−1+1)·k` after the reduced
vertex bookkeeping is absorbed into `t`).  Lovett's family `pFamUnion V k` has index
`Σᵢ Fin(k − |vᵢ|)`, of cardinality `∑ᵢ (k − |vᵢ|)` (`card_pFamUnion_index`).  These match in
cardinality exactly when the `V*(k)` system has the generic shape `∑ᵢ (k − |vᵢ|) = t·k` — the
"`m` generator rows of the `k × n` MDS matrix" normalization of Lovett Def 1.4.  We record the
bijection at that shape; it is the index identification any ring-change transfer must perform. -/

/-- **The column-index bijection brick.**  When the `V*(k)` system `V : Fin m → Fin n → ℕ` has
the generic shape `∑ᵢ (k − |vᵢ|) = t · k`, the AGL24 RIM column index `Fin t × Fin k` is in
bijection with Lovett's family index `Σᵢ Fin(k − |vᵢ|)`.  Field-independent; purely a counting
identification (both sides are finite of equal cardinality).  Axiom-clean. -/

`V*(k)`-shaped system over `m = t` rows has `∑ᵢ (k − |vᵢ|) = t · k`, so the column-index
bijection is inhabited at the generic shape.  (This is a *shape* witness for the bijection, not
a claim that the all-zero system is `V*(k)` — `IsVStar` fails for `t ≥ 2`; the genuine `vᵢ`
encode the edge structure.  The point is only that the cardinality identity `∑(k−|vᵢ|)=t·k` is
satisfiable, so `rimCols_equiv_pFamUnion_index_of_shape` is non-vacuous.)  Axiom-clean. -/
