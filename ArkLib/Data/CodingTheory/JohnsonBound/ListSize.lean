# The Johnson list-size bound (combinatorial, isolated)

This file proves the classical **q-ary Johnson bound** on the number of codewords of a code that lie
within a given Hamming radius of a fixed word — the foundational list-decoding bound underlying the
correlated-agreement / proximity-gap "true form" (the Johnson radius `δ < 1 - √ρ`), which is
**absent from mathlib**.

It is deliberately **self-contained**: it imports only `Mathlib` (Hamming distance, big operators,
the Cauchy–Schwarz sum inequality), so it builds independently of the rest of ArkLib. The
"universal-over-all-codes" form of the proximity gap is false; the correct form lives at the Johnson
radius, whose combinatorial heart is the bound below.

## Main statement

`card_mul_johnsonDenom_le`: for a finite set of codewords `C` with pairwise distance `≥ d`, all
within distance `e` of a word `w`, writing `n = |ι|`:

  `(C.card) · ((n - e)² - n·(n - d)) ≤ n · d`.

In the **Johnson regime** `(n - e)² > n·(n - d)` this yields `card_le_div` :
`C.card ≤ n·d / ((n - e)² - n·(n - d))`.

## Proof

Double counting. For each coordinate `i`, `colCount i` is the number of codewords agreeing with `w`
at `i`. Then `∑ i, colCount i = ∑ c, agree(c, w) ≥ |C|·(n - e)` and, by Cauchy–Schwarz,
`(∑ i, colCount i)² ≤ n · ∑ i, (colCount i)²`. Expanding `∑ i, (colCount i)²` over ordered pairs of
codewords, the diagonal contributes `∑ c, agree(c, w) ≤ |C|·n` and each off-diagonal pair `(c, c')`
contributes `agree(c, c') ≤ n - d`. Combining and cancelling one factor of `|C|` gives the bound.
