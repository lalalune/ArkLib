# `johnson_bound_lambda_le_ell` is *false* as stated (Finding-26 style refutation)

`ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/JohnsonBound/Family.lean` carries a documented `sorry` for
`johnson_bound_lambda_le_ell` (ABF26 Theorem 3.2):

  for any code `C ⊆ Σ^n` with `|Σ| = q` and `ℓ ≥ 2`,
  `|Λ(C, J_{q,ℓ}(δ_min(C)))| ≤ ℓ`,  where  `δ_min(C) = minDist(C)/n`.

This file proves the statement is **not a theorem as stated** by exhibiting a concrete
instance whose conclusion fails (`johnson_bound_lambda_le_ell_false`). The documented
`sorry` therefore cannot be honestly discharged — the statement needs a hypothesis repair
(a proximity bound keeping the square-root argument of `Jqℓ` nonnegative).

## Why it is false

`Jqℓ q ℓ δ = (1 - 1/q) · (1 - √(1 - (q/(q-1))·(ℓ/(ℓ-1))·δ))`.  The standard q-ary
ℓ-Johnson bound is valid only in the regime where the radicand
`1 - (q/(q-1))·(ℓ/(ℓ-1))·δ` is **nonnegative**; the Lean statement carries no such
hypothesis.  Mathlib's `Real.sqrt` returns `0` on negative inputs, so once
`(q/(q-1))·(ℓ/(ℓ-1))·δ > 1` the radius collapses to the meaninglessly large value
`(1 - 1/q)`, and a ball of that radius can contain far more than `ℓ` codewords.

## The witness

Take `ι = Fin 2` (so `n = |ι| = 2`), `α = Fin 2` (so `q = 2`), `ℓ = 2`, and the explicit
three-word code

  `C = { ![0,0], ![0,1], ![1,0] } ⊆ (Fin 2 → Fin 2)`.

* `minDist(C) = 1` (the closest distinct pair `![0,0], ![0,1]` differs in one coordinate),
  so `δ_min = 1/2`.
* `(q/(q-1))·(ℓ/(ℓ-1))·δ_min = 2·2·(1/2) = 2 > 1`, hence the radicand is `1 - 2 = -1 < 0`,
  `√(-1) = 0`, and `Jqℓ 2 2 (1/2) = (1 - 1/2)·(1 - 0) = 1/2`.
* Centring at `f = ![0,0]`, all three codewords lie within relative distance `1/2`
  (distances `0, 1/2, 1/2`), so `closeCodewordsRel C f (1/2) = C` has `ncard = 3` and
  `Λ(C, 1/2) ≥ 3 > 2 = ℓ`.

Hence `|Λ(C, J_{q,ℓ}(δ_min(C)))| = 3 > 2 = ℓ`, refuting the statement.

The one subtlety is that `relHammingBall` is defined with `open Classical`, so the ball
membership uses `Classical.propDecidable` whereas the `Fin 2` codeword facts compute with
`instDecidableEqFin`.  These give *equal* relative distances (`relHammingDist`'s value is
instance-independent); the helper `mem_ball_of_mem_C` is therefore stated for an *arbitrary*
`DecidableEq α` instance so it applies to whichever instance the ball carries.

For the concrete code `C = { ![0,0], ![0,1], ![1,0] } ⊆ (Fin 2 → Fin 2)` and `ℓ = 2`, the
conclusion `Lambda C (Jqℓ q ℓ δ_min) ≤ ℓ` FAILS: the left side is `≥ 3` while the right side
is `2`.  The failure is intrinsic to the unconditioned statement — `δ_min = 1/2` drives the
square-root argument of `Jqℓ` negative, `Real.sqrt` clamps it to `0`, and the Johnson
"radius" collapses to `1/2`, a ball that swallows the entire code.  The theorem needs a
proximity hypothesis (`(q/(q-1))·(ℓ/(ℓ-1))·δ_min ≤ 1`) that the present statement lacks. -/
