# Johnson-bound statement-level witness data

This file records the concrete three-word binary code used to audit
`johnson_bound_lambda_le_ell`.  The full Lambda contradiction is intentionally not asserted here:
the current kernel-clean artifact is the finite witness and its minimum-distance computation.
