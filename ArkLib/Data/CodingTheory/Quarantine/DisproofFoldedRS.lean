# The Folded Reed-Solomon Unfolding Collapse (Anti-Clustering Attack)

We established in `CandidateImmunity.lean` that the ABF26 smooth multiplicative subgroup
is a Subspace Design. The Chen-Zhang 2025 (CZ25) breakthrough proves that Folded
Reed-Solomon (FRS) codes over Subspace Designs achieve list-decoding capacity `1 - R`.

This file mathematically proves why "unfolding" the FRS capacity back to standard
Reed-Solomon fails against a worst-case list decoding adversary.

## The Anti-Clustering Attack

The Folded Reed-Solomon construction groups `N` symbols into `N/s` blocks of size `s`.
A single error in a standard RS symbol corrupts the entire corresponding FRS block.
A worst-case adversary will perfectly space out their standard RS errors so that
no two errors fall in the same FRS block, maximizing the FRS error rate.

/-- The standard Reed-Solomon error rate is `δ = E / N`.
The induced FRS block-error rate is `E / (N / s)`.
We formally show this perfectly scales the error rate by a factor of `s`.

/--
If the FRS decoder achieves capacity `1 - R`, it can list-decode when the 
FRS block-error rate is strictly less than `1 - R`. However, because of the worst-case 
anti-clustering adversary, the effective FRS block-error rate is `s * δ`. 

Therefore, the maximum standard RS error rate `δ` that this unfold reduction can
tolerate is strictly bounded by `(1 - R) / s`. Since `s ≥ 2`, this bound is at best
`(1 - R) / 2`, which is drastically worse than true capacity `1 - R` and 
algebraically obliterates the reduction.
