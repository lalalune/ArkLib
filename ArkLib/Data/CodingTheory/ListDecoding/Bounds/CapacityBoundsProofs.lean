/-- **Guruswami–Sudan list-decoding bound.** Interpolating a single `Q` from the received word,
*every* low-degree polynomial `f` that agrees with `received` on more than
`deg_X + deg_Y · deg(f)` (multiplicity-weighted) points makes the substitution `Q(X, f(X))`
vanish, hence is a `Y`-root of `Q`. As `Q` has `Y`-degree `≤ deg_Y`, there are at most `deg_Y`
such codewords.

This is the headline classical list-decoding theorem: it composes the interpolation
(`gkl24_interpolation_existence`), the per-codeword vanishing (`rootMultiplicity_aeval_ge` +
`bchks25_vanishing…`), and the list-size bound (`gs_list_size_bound`). -/
