# ABF26 T3.4 [CZ25 Thm B.5]: subspace-design ⟹ list-size bound (design→Λ conversion)

This file attacks **ABF26 Theorem 3.4** [CZ25 Thm B.5], the general
"τ-subspace-design ⟹ list-decodable up to capacity" theorem, recorded in
`ListDecoding/Bounds.lean` as the external admit `subspaceDesign_list_decoding_cz25`.

The ground-truth statement shape (the one consumed by
`CZ25CapacityReduction.frs_list_decoding_capacity_cz25_of_T34_T218`, which already turns
T3.4 + T2.18 into the C3.5 folded-RS capacity bound) is, for a τ-subspace-design code
`C : Submodule F (ι → Fin s → F)`, every `η' > 0`, and with `r₀ := ⌊1/η'⌋`:

  `Λ(C, 1 - τ(r₀) - η') ≤ (1 - τ(r₀)) / η'`   (as `ENNReal`).

## The CZ25 / Guruswami–Kopparty argument (paper level)

Fix a received word `f`. Let `δ := 1 - τ(r₀) - η'` be the decoding radius and
`L := closeCodewordsRel C f δ = { c ∈ C : δᵣ(f, c) ≤ δ }` the candidate list; write
`ℓ := |L|`. Each `c ∈ L` agrees with `f` on at least `(1 - δ)·n = (τ(r₀) + η')·n`
coordinates (blocks of `Fin s → F`).

The subspace-design property bounds the *total agreement* the list can carry. Pick
`c₀ ∈ L` and form the `F`-subspace `A := span{ c - c₀ : c ∈ L } ≤ C`, of dimension
`m ≤ ℓ - 1`. The design inequality at radius `m` (valid once `m ≤ r₀`) reads
`(Σ_i dim A_i)/n ≤ m · τ(r₀)`, where `A_i = A ∩ ker(eval_i)` collects the differences
vanishing at block `i`. Double-counting per-coordinate agreement against this design
budget, and feeding back `m ≤ ℓ - 1`, collapses to the *agreement-budget* inequality

  `ℓ · η' ≤ 1 - τ(r₀)`,   i.e.   `ℓ ≤ (1 - τ(r₀)) / η'`.

(Each list element consumes a fresh `η'·n` slice of an agreement budget capped at
`(1 - τ(r₀))·n`.) Maximising over `f` gives the `Λ` bound.

## What is proven here vs. the residual

The genuinely substrate-heavy step is the **per-word real dimension count**: the affine
span `A`, the per-coordinate agreement subspaces `A_i`, and the collapse of the design
inequality to `ℓ ≤ (1 - τ(r₀))/η'`. Mathlib has no subspace-design / agreement-span API,
so this kernel is isolated as the named residual

  `CZ25DimensionCount` — the per-word real bound `|L| ≤ (1 - τ(r₀))/η'`.

**Everything else is proven here, `sorry`-free and axiom-clean:**

* the negative-radius / out-of-range edge cases (`δ < 0 ⟹ L = ∅`), which are handled
  *outside* the residual so the residual only ever faces the non-degenerate regime;
* the `ℝ`-membership bridge for `closeCodewordsRel` (relating `δᵣ(f,c) ≤ δ` to the real
  inequality `(δᵣ(f,c) : ℝ) ≤ δ`);
* the packaging of the per-word `ncard` bounds into the maximised `Λ` via
  `Lambda_le_of_forall_ncard_le`, and the `ENat`→`ENNReal`→`ENNReal.ofReal` coercion.

The headline reduction `subspaceDesign_list_decoding_cz25_of_dimensionCount` derives the
**exact** in-tree T3.4 statement from `CZ25DimensionCount`. This pins the residual to the
irreducible CZ25 dimension-counting core and discharges the conversion's own content.

These facts are stated for a *general* alphabet `α` (only `Nonempty ι`, `Fintype ι`,
`DecidableEq α` are needed for `relHammingDist`), so that they apply at the block alphabet
`α = Fin s → F` used by subspace-design codes — there `α` is **not** a field. -/

/-! ### The residual: the CZ25 per-word dimension-counting bound -/

/-- **Residual (CZ25 dimension-counting core).** For a τ-subspace-design code `C` and any
`η' > 0`, every received word `f` has a candidate list of bounded cardinality at the
capacity radius. Concretely, with `r₀ := ⌊1/η'⌋` and the radius
`δ := 1 - τ(r₀) - η'`,

  `|closeCodewordsRel C f δ| ≤ (1 - τ(r₀)) / η'`   (over `ℝ`).

This is the genuine CZ25 / Guruswami–Kopparty content (the affine-span dimension count
against the subspace-design budget; see the file header), and the *only* admitted
ingredient of T3.4. It is stated for the non-degenerate regime that the conversion
actually feeds it: when `δ < 0` the list is provably empty (handled in-tree by
`ncard_closeCodewordsRel_eq_zero_of_neg`), so this residual is only ever invoked with
`(1 - τ(r₀))/η' ≥ 0`. -/

Given the CZ25 dimension-counting core `CZ25DimensionCount` as a hypothesis, the full
in-tree T3.4 `Λ`-bound follows. We package the per-word real `ncard` bounds into the
maximised `Λ` via `Lambda_le_of_forall_ncard_le` and the `ENat`→`ENNReal.ofReal`
coercion, with the negative-radius regime discharged in-tree. No `sorry`, no new axioms;
the entire residual lives in `hDC`. -/
