# CZ25 dimension count: the design half + the strictly-smaller agreement residual

This file dissects the last kernel of the FRS capacity chain,
`CodingTheory.CZ25DimensionCount` (the per-received-word real bound
`|Λ(C,δ,f)| ≤ (1 - τ(r₀))/η` against an `IsSubspaceDesign` budget, isolated in
`ListDecoding/CZ25DesignToLambda.lean`). It pins where the genuinely-deep Guruswami–Wang /
CZ25 [CZ25 Thm B.5] content lives, and discharges everything around it.

## The classical argument and where it is hard (paper level)

Fix `f` and write the candidate list `L := closeCodewordsRel C f δ`, `ℓ := |L|`, at radius
`δ := 1 - τ(r₀) - η`. Each `c ∈ L` agrees with `f` on `≥ (1-δ)·n = (τ(r₀)+η)·n` of the `n`
block coordinates `i : ι`. Pick a base `c₀ ∈ L`, recentre, and let `A := span{c - c₀ : c ∈ L}`,
a subspace of `C` of dimension `m ≤ ℓ - 1`. Realise `A` by an **independent** family
`b : Fin m → A` (a basis), and per coordinate `i` collect the basis vectors vanishing at `i`,
`S i := {t : b t i = 0}`.

The argument has two halves:

* **The design half (proven here).** The subspace-design inequality at radius `r₀` (valid
  since `m ≤ r₀`) bounds the *total vanishing mass* the basis can carry:

    `∑_i |S i| ≤ ∑_i dim(A ⊓ ker eval_i) ≤ m · τ(r₀) · n`.

  The first `≤` is the genuinely-reusable linear-algebra fact that an independent subfamily
  landing in `A ⊓ ker eval_i` witnesses dimension at least `|S i|`
  (`finrank_inf_ker_ge_card_vanishing`); the second is the `IsSubspaceDesign` hypothesis. We
  prove the bundled statement as `sum_card_vanishing_le_design`.

* **The agreement half (the irreducible residual).** Translating the *fresh* agreement
  `(τ(r₀)+η)·n` that each new list element contributes — through the iterative span
  construction — into the affine-dimension inequality

    `m · η ≤ 1 - τ(r₀) - η`,

  together with the list↔span link `ℓ ≤ m + 1`, is the genuinely-deep Guruswami–Wang
  iterative charge. A single base point plus a per-coordinate mass bound is provably
  **insufficient** for the *linear*-in-`ℓ` bound (it only yields the `r₀`-independent
  τ-constraint `τ(r₀) ≥ 1 - 2η`), so this half has no shortcut over the design budget and is
  isolated as the strictly-smaller residual `CZ25SpanBound` below.

## What is proven here vs. the residual

* `finrank_inf_ker_ge_card_vanishing` — per-coordinate independence ⟹ dimension bound
  (reusable; `sorry`-free, axiom-clean).
* `sum_card_vanishing_le_design` — the **design half**: `∑_i |S i| ≤ m · τ(r₀) · n`
  (reusable; consumes only `IsSubspaceDesign`; `sorry`-free, axiom-clean).
* `CZ25SpanBound` — the strictly-smaller residual: per `f`, an affine-span witness giving
  `ℓ ≤ m + 1` and `m · η ≤ 1 - τ(r₀) - η`. It carries **none** of the `ℝ`-cast / `ncard`
  edge-case / `Lambda` packaging that `CZ25DimensionCount` bundles, and exposes the affine
  dimension `m` explicitly.
* `cz25DimensionCount_of_spanBound` — `CZ25SpanBound ⟹ CZ25DimensionCount` (the arithmetic
  collapse `ℓ ≤ m+1 ≤ (1-τ(r₀))/η`; `sorry`-free, axiom-clean).
* `subspaceDesign_list_decoding_cz25_of_spanBound` — composing with the existing reduction
  `subspaceDesign_list_decoding_cz25_of_dimensionCount`, the in-tree T3.4 `Λ`-bound follows
  from `CZ25SpanBound` directly.

**Refutation + correction (2026-06-06).** `CZ25SpanBound` *as originally stated* is
**false** in the negative-radix regime `δ := 1 - τ(⌊1/η⌋) - η < 0` — its witness clause
`m·η ≤ δ` has nonnegative left side but negative right side, so it is unsatisfiable
(`cz25SpanBound_false_of_neg_radius`). That regime is reachable by genuine FRS designs
(`τ(r₀) = 1` whenever `r₀ = ⌊1/η⌋ > s`, i.e. `η < 1/s`), where the *true* statement
`CZ25DimensionCount` holds vacuously (empty list). The faithful residual is `CZ25SpanBound'`,
the same witness clause **guarded** by `0 ≤ δ` (mirroring the consumer's own `δ`-sign split):

* `cz25SpanBound_false_of_neg_radius` — the kernel refutation (the witness clause is
  unsatisfiable when `δ < 0`).
* `CZ25SpanBound'` — the corrected, guarded residual.
* `cz25SpanBound'_of_dimensionCount` — `CZ25DimensionCount ⟹ CZ25SpanBound'` via the only
  valid witness `m = |L| - 1`, establishing that the corrected residual carries exactly the
  genuine CZ25 content (it is equivalent to `CZ25DimensionCount` on `δ ≥ 0`).
* `subspaceDesign_list_decoding_cz25_of_spanBound'` — the in-tree T3.4 `Λ`-bound from the
  corrected residual, routing `δ < 0` through the empty list where it belongs.

## Sanity check (tiny example, `q = 5`, `n = 4`, `k = 1`, `δ = 1/4`)

Take `s = 1` (alphabet `F = 𝔽₅`), `n = 4`, a dimension-`1` code (`k = 1`), `η = 1/4` so
`r₀ = ⌊1/η⌋ = 4` and `δ = 1 - τ(4) - 1/4`. A `1`-dimensional code is spanned by one nonzero
`c`, so the only nonzero codewords are its `4` scalar multiples; any two distinct codewords
differ in *every* coordinate (minimum distance `n`), so `τ(r) ≥ (n - d)/n = 0` from
`subspaceDesign_tau_lower`, giving `δ ≤ 3/4`. The list `L` around any `f` then has at most
one codeword within relative radius `δ < 1`, i.e. `ℓ ≤ 1`. The span witness is `m = 0`
(`A = ⊥`): `ℓ ≤ m + 1 = 1` ✓ and `m · η = 0 ≤ 1 - τ(4) - 1/4` ✓ (as `τ(4) ≤ 3/4`), and the
collapse gives `ℓ ≤ (1 - τ(4))/η`, consistent.

/-- **Residual (CZ25 agreement half — strictly smaller than `CZ25DimensionCount`).** For a
τ-subspace-design code `C` and `η > 0`, with `r₀ := ⌊1/η⌋` and radius `δ := 1 - τ(r₀) - η`,
every received word `f` admits an **affine-span witness** for its candidate list
`L := closeCodewordsRel C f δ`: a natural number `m` (the affine dimension of the recentred
list span) with

  `|L| ≤ m + 1`        (the list↔span+1 link) and
  `m · η ≤ 1 - τ(r₀) - η`   (the affine-dimension agreement bound).

This is the genuinely-deep Guruswami–Wang iterative charge (each new list element contributes
a *fresh* `η·n` slice of agreement to a budget capped at `(1 - τ(r₀))·n`). It carries **none**
of the `ℝ`-cast / `ncard` edge-case / `Lambda`-packaging of `CZ25DimensionCount`, and exposes
the affine dimension `m` explicitly — so it is strictly smaller than that residual, which it
implies via `cz25DimensionCount_of_spanBound`. The design half of the count
(`sum_card_vanishing_le_design`) is supplied as proven, reusable infrastructure; only this
agreement half remains admitted. -/

/-! ### Kernel refutation of `CZ25SpanBound` as stated, and the corrected residual

**Finding (2026-06-06).** `CZ25SpanBound` as literally stated is **false** — and not at a
degenerate edge but in a regime reachable by genuine FRS subspace designs. The per-word
existential demands a natural number `m` with `(m : ℝ) · η ≤ 1 - τ(⌊1/η⌋) - η`. The left
side is `≥ 0` (as `m : ℕ` and `η > 0`), so the clause is **unsatisfiable whenever the radix
`δ := 1 - τ(⌊1/η⌋) - η` is negative**, regardless of the list. This is
`cz25SpanBound_false_of_neg_radius` below.

The `δ < 0` regime is reachable: for the FRS design profile
`τ(r) = (k-1)/n` on `r ∈ [1,s]` and `τ(r) = 1` otherwise
(`frs_is_subspaceDesign_gk16_of_admissible`), taking `η < 1/s` forces `r₀ = ⌊1/η⌋ > s`,
hence `τ(r₀) = 1` and `δ = -η < 0`. There the *true* theorem `CZ25DimensionCount` holds
vacuously (the list is empty by `closeCodewordsRel_eq_empty_of_neg`, so
`|L| = 0 ≤ (1-τ(r₀))/η`), yet `CZ25SpanBound` asserts the impossible. So `CZ25SpanBound`
does **not** follow from the genuine CZ25 content; it was over-stated by reverse-engineering
the witness clause without the consumer's `δ ≥ 0` guard.

**Correction.** The faithful residual is `CZ25SpanBound'`: the affine-span witness clause
guarded by the non-degenerate hypothesis `0 ≤ δ`, exactly mirroring the `δ`-sign split that
the *consumer* `subspaceDesign_list_decoding_cz25_of_dimensionCount` already performs (it
routes `δ < 0` through `closeCodewordsRel_eq_empty_of_neg`, never through the residual). With
the guard, the witness clause is satisfiable and the reduction to T3.4 goes through directly
(`subspaceDesign_list_decoding_cz25_of_spanBound'`). The corrected residual is moreover
**equivalent** to `CZ25DimensionCount` on the non-degenerate regime
(`cz25SpanBound'_of_dimensionCount`, via the only valid witness `m = |L| - 1`), so it carries
exactly the genuine Guruswami–Wang content — no more, no less — without the spurious
unprovable `δ < 0` obligation.

**On the missing proof.** Neither residual is *discharged* here: the genuine
agreement-budget bound `|L| ≤ (1-τ(r₀))/η` from `IsSubspaceDesign` is the irreducible
Guruswami–Wang / Johnson content, and a numerical audit (toy RS / full codes over small
fields) confirms the naive double-counting charge `#{c ∈ L : c_i = f_i} - 1 ≤ dim(A ⊓ ker eval_i)`
that would bridge `sum_card_vanishing_le_design` to the list bound is **false**: agreeing-at-`i`
list elements fill an affine flat of direction `A ⊓ ker eval_i`, so their count is `q^{dim}`
(exponential), not `dim + 1` (linear), past the Johnson radius. The `m = dim(span{c - c₀})`
witness likewise fails `|L| ≤ m + 1` (a span of dimension `m` carries up to `q^m` list
elements). The only valid witness is the tautological `m = |L| - 1`, which makes the second
inequality the full capacity theorem — confirming the residual has no shortcut over the
design budget. -/

`δ < 0` regime (see `cz25SpanBound_false_of_neg_radius`). On the non-degenerate regime this

through the empty list (`closeCodewordsRel_eq_empty_of_neg`), exactly where it belongs; the
residual is only consulted on the non-degenerate regime `δ ≥ 0` it can actually satisfy. No
`sorry`, no new axioms. -/
