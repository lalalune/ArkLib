# Univariate polynomial agreement soundness (FRI / sum-check round)

Two distinct univariate polynomials of degree `≤ d` over a field `F` agree at at most `d` points
(their difference is a nonzero degree-`≤ d` polynomial, with at most `degree` roots).  In
probability form, a uniformly random point witnesses agreement with probability `≤ d/|F|`.

This is the soundness of one FRI folding / univariate sum-check round (the prover commits to a
claimed low-degree polynomial; a random evaluation catches any deviation except with probability
`d/|F|`) — the classical Schwartz–Zippel / DeMillo–Lipton bound in one variable.
