# Hensel lifting in the BCIKS20-application shape (series-coefficient polynomials)

`HenselExistence.lean` proves abstract Hensel for a polynomial `P : R[X]` whose coefficients
are *constants* in `R`, lifting a simple root `c : R` to a root `γ : R⟦X⟧`. The BCIKS20
quotienting argument (App. A.4) requires the **application shape**: the polynomial whose root we
lift already has **power-series coefficients**,

  `Q : Polynomial R⟦X⟧`,

with root data prescribed only at **order 0**. Concretely, let

  `Q₀ : R[X] := Q.map (constantCoeff)`        (the order-0 reduction, `constantCoeff` a `RingHom`)

and let `c : R` be a *simple* root of `Q₀`:

* `eval c Q₀ = 0`,
* `IsUnit (eval c (derivative Q₀))`.

**Main theorems.**

* `exists_powerSeries_root_seriesCoeff` (EXISTENCE): there is `γ : R⟦X⟧` with
  `constantCoeff γ = c` and `Polynomial.eval γ Q = 0`. Here the evaluation is the *plain*
  `Polynomial.eval γ Q`: `Q`'s coefficients already live in `R⟦X⟧`, the same ring as `γ`, so
  `eval` (not `aeval`/`eval₂`) is the right and cleanest primitive.
* `root_unique_seriesCoeff` (UNIQUENESS): two roots of `Q` sharing the same constant coefficient
  are equal.

**The new ingredient — generalized linearization with a convolution.** With series coefficients
the order-`t` coefficient of `eval γ Q` expands as a *double* sum (a convolution over each
coefficient series):

  `coeff t (eval γ Q) = ∑ᵢ ∑_{a+b=t} coeff a (Q.coeff i) · coeff b (γ^i)`.

Comparing two series `γ₁, γ₂` that agree below order `t` (`0 < t`): truncation propagation
(`coeff_pow_sub_below`) makes `coeff b (γ₁^i) = coeff b (γ₂^i)` for every `b < t`, so **only the
`b = t` (hence `a = 0`) corner of each convolution survives the difference**. The surviving
`a = 0` factor is `coeff 0 (Q.coeff i) = constantCoeff (Q.coeff i) = Q₀.coeff i`, a *constant*.
Thus the convolution collapses to exactly the constant-coefficient linearization of
`HenselExistence`, but against `Q₀`:

  `coeff t (eval γ₁ Q) − coeff t (eval γ₂ Q) = eval c (derivative Q₀) · (coeff t γ₁ − coeff t γ₂)`.

From there the Newton recursion and order-by-order vanishing are *verbatim* those of
`HenselExistence` (the linear response `eval c (derivative Q₀)` is a unit by hypothesis, and the
order-0 coefficient is `eval c Q₀ = 0`), so the same construction lifts `c` to a root of `Q`.

**Self-containment.** `HenselExistence` / `NewtonLinearization` are on this branch but their
`olean`s are not prebuilt here, and they are stated for `R[X]` (constant coefficients), not the
`R⟦X⟧[X]` shape, so the two power-only lemmas that transfer unchanged — truncation propagation
(LEMMA A) and the Newton power linearization (LEMMA B) — are **restated and reproven locally**
(namespace `HenselSeriesCoeff`), and the file depends only on mathlib.

  rw [Polynomial.eval_eq_sum_range, map_sum]

/-! ## Generalized linearization — the order-`t` Newton response is `Q₀′(c)` -/

/-- **Generalized Newton/Hensel linearization (series-coefficient form).** For `γ₁ γ₂ : R⟦X⟧`
agreeing below order `t` (`0 < t`), writing `c := constantCoeff γ₁`, the order-`t` coefficient
of `eval γ Q` is `Q₀′(c)`-linear in the order-`t` perturbation:

  `coeff t (eval γ₁ Q) − coeff t (eval γ₂ Q) = eval c (derivative Q₀) · (coeff t γ₁ − coeff t γ₂)`.

**Proof.** Expand both sides via `coeff_eval_eq_sum_range`; the `i`-th difference is
`coeff t (Q.coeff i · γ₁^i) − coeff t (Q.coeff i · γ₂^i)`. Expanding each
`coeff t (Q.coeff i · γ^i)` over `antidiagonal t` by `coeff_mul` and subtracting, every
antidiagonal pair `(a,b)` with `b < t` cancels (its `γ^i` factor agrees by LEMMA A), leaving only
the corner `(0, t)`:

  `= coeff 0 (Q.coeff i) · (coeff t (γ₁^i) − coeff t (γ₂^i)) = (Q₀.coeff i) · (coeff t γ₁^i − …)`.

LEMMA B (`coeff_pow_sub_at`) evaluates the power difference to `i • (c^{i-1} δ)`, and the sum
`∑ᵢ (Q₀.coeff i) · i · c^{i-1} = eval c (derivative Q₀)` by `derivative_eval` + `sum_over_range'`.
This is exactly the constant-coefficient finish of `HenselExistence`, but against `Q₀`. -/

/-- **Uniqueness in the application shape.** Two roots of `Q : Polynomial R⟦X⟧` that share a

**Proof.** Suppose `γ₁ ≠ γ₂`; let `t` be minimal with `coeff t γ₁ ≠ coeff t γ₂`. Since both share
the constant coefficient `c = constantCoeff γ₁ = constantCoeff γ₂`, we have `t ≠ 0`, i.e. `0 < t`,
and `γ₁, γ₂` agree below order `t`. Both evaluate to `0`, so the generalized linearization
(`coeff_eval_sub_at`) gives `0 = eval c (derivative Q₀) · (coeff t γ₁ − coeff t γ₂)`. Multiplying
by the inverse of the unit `eval c (derivative Q₀)` forces `coeff t γ₁ = coeff t γ₂`,
contradicting minimality. Hence `γ₁ = γ₂`. -/

/-! ## Axiom audit

In-file `#print axioms` (run on a temp copy, then removed — see disposition note) is intended to
confirm every declaration depends only on `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`: no
`sorryAx`, no `native_decide` / `Lean.ofReduceBool`. -/
