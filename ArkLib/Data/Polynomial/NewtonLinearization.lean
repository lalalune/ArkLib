# Newton-step linearization for power-series powers (BCIKS20 App. A.4 — P2 path)

The structural lemma underlying the order-by-order `R(X, γ, Z) = 0` induction of
[BCIKS20] App. A.4. We work over a fixed commutative ring `R` with two power series
`γ₁ γ₂ : R⟦X⟧` that **agree below truncation order `t`** (all coefficients `j < t`,
including the constant term `j = 0` — so in particular `constantCoeff γ₁ = constantCoeff γ₂`).
The point of the induction is to compute, to *first order in the order-`t` perturbation*
`δ := coeff t γ₁ − coeff t γ₂`, the difference of the order-`t` coefficients of the composed
series `P(γ₁)` and `P(γ₂)` for a polynomial `P`.

Three results:

* **`coeff_pow_sub_below`** (LEMMA A, truncation propagation): agreement below `t`
  propagates to every power `γ^i`. Proof: induction on `i`; `coeff_mul` only references
  coefficient indices `a, b` with `a + b = j < t`, hence `a, b < t`.

* **`coeff_pow_sub_at`** (LEMMA B, linearization): under the same hypothesis with `0 < t`,
  writing `c := constantCoeff γ₁`,
  `coeff t (γ₁^(i+1)) − coeff t (γ₂^(i+1)) = (i+1) • (c^i · (coeff t γ₁ − coeff t γ₂))`.
  (The subtraction-free `(i+1)` shape sidesteps the `i − 1` in `ℕ`.) Proof: induction on `i`;
  in the `coeff_mul`/antidiagonal expansion of `γ^(i+1) = γ^i · γ`, every interior antidiagonal
  pair `(a, b)` with `a + b = t` other than the ends `(t, 0)`/`(0, t)` has `a < t` and `b < t`,
  so it agrees between the two series by LEMMA A (`γ^i` factor) and the below-`t` hypothesis
  (`γ` factor) and cancels in the difference; the end terms `(t,0): δ · c^i` and
  `(0,t): c^{i+1} · δ` assemble with the inductive hypothesis into `(i+1) • (c^i δ)`.

* **`coeff_aeval_sub_at`** (COROLLARY, the P2-facing form): for a polynomial `P`,
  `coeff t (aeval γ₁ P) − coeff t (aeval γ₂ P) = (eval c (derivative P)) · (coeff t γ₁ − coeff t γ₂)`.
  The composed-series order-`t` coefficient is `P′(c)`-linear in the order-`t` input — exactly
  the Newton/Hensel linearization driving the order-by-order vanishing argument. The
  `aeval`-expansion `coeff t (aeval γ P) = ∑ᵢ Pᵢ · coeff t (γ^i)` is restated locally
  (mirroring `coeff_aeval_powerSeries` of `GammaSubstObstruction.lean`) so this file depends
  only on mathlib.

/-- **Truncation propagation.** If `γ₁ γ₂ : R⟦X⟧` agree at every coefficient
`j < t`, then so do `γ₁^i` and `γ₂^i`, for every `i`.

Proof by induction on `i`. The `coeff_mul` antidiagonal sum for `coeff j (γ * γ^i)` only
references coefficient indices `a, b` with `a + b = j < t`, so both `a < t` and `b < t`,
where the hypothesis, respectively the inductive hypothesis, supplies agreement. -/

/-! ## LEMMA B — Newton linearization at order `t` -/

/-- **Newton linearization at order `t`.** Under the below-`t` agreement hypothesis with
`0 < t`, writing `c := constantCoeff γ₁` (`= constantCoeff γ₂`) and
`δ := coeff t γ₁ − coeff t γ₂`, the order-`t` coefficients of the `(i+1)`-th powers differ by

  `coeff t (γ₁^(i+1)) − coeff t (γ₂^(i+1)) = (i+1) • (c^i · δ)`.

(The `(i+1)` shape avoids the `i − 1` of the textbook `i • c^{i-1}` form in `ℕ`.)

Proof by induction on `i`. Expanding `γ^(i+1) = γ^i · γ` via `coeff_mul` over
`Finset.antidiagonal t`, the only antidiagonal pairs `(a, b)` with `a + b = t` carrying the
order-`t` perturbation are the ends `(t, 0)` and `(0, t)`: every other pair has `a < t` and
`b < t`, so the `γ^i`-factor agrees by LEMMA A and the `γ`-factor agrees by hypothesis, and
those interior terms cancel in the difference. The end-term contributions are
`(t,0): (coeff t γ₁^(i+1) − coeff t γ₂^(i+1)) · c` and `(0,t): c^{i+1} · δ`; the inductive
hypothesis rewrites the former as `((i+1) • (c^i δ)) · c = (i+1) • (c^{i+1} δ)`, and the
total is `(i+2) • (c^{i+1} δ)`. -/

/-- **Newton/Hensel linearization of the composed series (P2 form).** For a polynomial `P`
over `R` and power series `γ₁ γ₂` agreeing below order `t` (with `0 < t`), writing
`c := constantCoeff γ₁` (`= constantCoeff γ₂`), the order-`t` coefficient of `P(γ)` is
`P′(c)`-linear in the order-`t` perturbation:

  `coeff t (aeval γ₁ P) − coeff t (aeval γ₂ P) = eval c (derivative P) · (coeff t γ₁ − coeff t γ₂)`.

Proof: expand both sides over `range (natDegree P + 1)` via `coeff_aeval_eq_sum_range`; the
`i`-th difference is `P.coeff i · (coeff t (γ₁^i) − coeff t (γ₂^i))`, which LEMMA B
(`coeff_pow_sub_at`) evaluates to `P.coeff i · (i • (c^{i-1} δ))`. The `i = 0` term is `0`
(empty `c^{-1}` handled by the `(i+1)`-shape: the `i = 0` summand contributes `0` since
`coeff t (γ^0) = coeff t 1 = 0` for `t > 0`). Summing
`∑ i, P.coeff i · i · c^{i-1} = eval c (derivative P)` is `derivative_eval` after reindexing.
