# The γ-substitution obstruction (BCIKS20 App. A.4 — P2 frontier)

A kernel-checked obstruction explaining why the Hensel-lift power series `γ` of
`RationalFunctions.lean` (`def γ … := PowerSeries.subst (PowerSeries.mk subst) (mk α)`,
where `subst 0 = fieldTo𝕃 (-x₀)`, `subst 1 = 1`, `subst _ = 0` — i.e. the substituted
series is `C (-x₀) + X`) is **degenerate for `x₀ ≠ 0`**:

`PowerSeries.subst` only behaves as composition when the substituted series satisfies
`PowerSeries.HasSubst`, i.e. its constant coefficient is nilpotent
(`HasSubst a := IsNilpotent (constantCoeff a)`). The γ-substitution series `C (-x₀) + X`
has constant coefficient `-x₀`, which over a field is nilpotent **iff `x₀ = 0`**. Hence:

* for `x₀ ≠ 0`, `HasSubst` fails, so the `coeff_subst` composition-coefficient formula
  (the engine of the wave-3/4 Faà-di-Bruno P2 path) **does not apply to γ as defined** —
  `γ` is not the intended composition and the planned order-by-order vanishing argument
  is invalid until the definition is recentered;
* the faithful fix is to substitute the **local variable** `X' := X - x₀` (constant
  coefficient `0`, trivially nilpotent), i.e. treat `γ` as a power series in `X'`.

This is a second definitional gap on the P2 chain, parallel to the `β_regular = 0` stub:
both `β`/`α`/`γ` must be re-anchored to the genuine recursive Hensel data before
`R(X, γ, Z) = 0` (P2) is even meaningfully provable. See
`research/proximity-prize/dispositions/pc-w2-P2-scout.md` and the wave-3 scout.

The lemma below is the precise, reusable, field-generic root of the obstruction.

/-- **γ-substitution obstruction (generic form).** Over a field `K`, the degree-`≤1`
power series `C c + X` is `HasSubst`-substitutable iff its constant term `c` vanishes.

This is exactly the shape of the γ-substitution series of [BCIKS20] App. A.4 with
`c = -x₀`: it can be substituted (so `PowerSeries.subst` is genuine composition) only when
`x₀ = 0`. For `x₀ ≠ 0` the `coeff_subst` machinery does not apply and the defined `γ` is
not the intended Hensel-lift series. -/

/-! ## The positive route: polynomial evaluation needs no `HasSubst`

The way *around* the obstruction for the `Y`-substitution `R(X, γ, Z)`: `R` is a
**polynomial** in `Y`, so substituting the power series `γ` for `Y` is `Polynomial.aeval`
— a finite sum — and requires no nilpotency side condition whatsoever. The
coefficient-extraction formula below is therefore the `HasSubst`-free composition engine
for the order-by-order vanishing argument of [BCIKS20] App. A.4 (P2): combined with
`coeff_pow_eq_valueMultisetSum` (in `PowerSeriesComposition.lean`), it expands the
order-`n` coefficient of `R(γ)` into the value-multiset (Faà-di-Bruno) sum that the
`B_{i1,λ}`/`partitionProd` machinery of `HenselNumerator.lean` consumes. Only the
`X`-recentering (a polynomial Taylor shift, also `HasSubst`-free) remains on that side. -/

/-- **`HasSubst`-free composition-coefficient formula.** For a *polynomial* `P` over a
commutative ring `R` evaluated (via `aeval`) at a power series `γ`, the order-`n`
coefficient is the finite sum of `P`-coefficients against coefficients of powers of `γ`:

  `coeff n (aeval γ P) = ∑_{i ≤ deg P} P.coeff i • coeff n (γ^i)`.

No nilpotency / `HasSubst` hypothesis: the sum is finite because `P` is a polynomial.
This is the engine that replaces `PowerSeries.coeff_subst` on the `Y`-leg of
`R(X, γ, Z)`. -/

    rw [PowerSeries.coeff_smul, smul_eq_mul]

/-- **Recentering bridge (the `X`-leg fix).** Evaluating the Taylor shift `taylor r P` at a
power series `γ` equals evaluating `P` itself at the shifted argument `γ + C r`:

  `aeval γ (taylor r P) = aeval (γ + C r) P`.

Consequence for the obstruction above: instead of substituting the bad series
`C (-x₀) + X` (whose `HasSubst` fails for `x₀ ≠ 0`) into anything, one works with the
**recentered** local series `γ'` (constant coefficient `0`) against the Taylor-shifted
polynomial — the two sides of this identity convert between the pictures, entirely
within polynomial evaluation (no `HasSubst` anywhere). -/

/-- **The combined `HasSubst`-free expansion.** Order-`n` coefficients of `P` evaluated at

against powers of the *recentered* `γ` — the full composition formula for the
[BCIKS20] App. A.4 setting (`r = α₀`, `γ` the strictly-positive-order part), with no
nilpotency condition. Chaining with `coeff_pow_eq_valueMultisetSum`
(`PowerSeriesComposition.lean`) lands the order-`n` Faà-di-Bruno form. -/

It is the reusable bridge from the polynomial-evaluation picture of the recentered
