# Hensel-root EXISTENCE for power series (abstract Hensel for `R⟦X⟧`)

Companion to the **uniqueness** half (`NewtonLinearization.aeval_root_unique`): we prove the
**existence** half of Hensel's lemma for the power-series ring `R⟦X⟧` over an arbitrary
commutative ring `R`.

**Main theorem (`exists_powerSeries_root`).** Given a polynomial `P : R[X]` and `c : R` with

* `eval c P = 0`            (`c` is a root of the order-0 data),
* `IsUnit (eval c P')`      (the root is *simple*),

there exists `γ : R⟦X⟧` with `constantCoeff γ = c` and `aeval γ P = 0`.

Together with `aeval_root_unique` this gives the full abstract Hensel statement for `R⟦X⟧`:
a simple root `c` of `P` over `R` lifts **uniquely** to a root of `P` over `R⟦X⟧`.

**Route.** Mathlib provides *no* `HenselianLocalRing R⟦X⟧` instance and *no*
`IsAdicComplete (X) R⟦X⟧` instance (the two abstract routes through
`Mathlib/RingTheory/Henselian.lean`), and the `HenselianLocalRing` API would in any case
require `R` local, `P` monic, and only a *residue-field* root — strictly weaker and not our
setting. So we proceed **by explicit Newton construction**, which is also more general (no
locality, no monicity, exact root).

**Construction.** Let `A := eval c P'`, `u := Ring.inverse A` (so `A * u = 1`). Build the
partial-sum sequence `S : ℕ → R⟦X⟧` by ordinary structural recursion:

* `S 0      := C c`                                   (constant series `c`),
* `S (t+1)  := S t + monomial (t+1) (-u * coeff (t+1) (aeval (S t) P))`.

Adding the order-`(t+1)` monomial leaves all coefficients `≤ t` unchanged, so the diagonal
`g t := coeff t (S t)` is *stable*: `coeff j (S t) = g j` for all `j ≤ t`. Define
`γ := mk g`. Then `γ` agrees with `S t` below order `t+1`, and the Newton linearization
(`coeff_aeval_sub_at`, restated locally below) forces `coeff (t+1) (aeval γ P) = 0` order by
order, while the base order-0 coefficient is `eval c P = 0`. Hence `aeval γ P = 0`.

**Self-containment.** The supporting lemmas live in `NewtonLinearization.lean` /
`GammaSubstObstruction.lean`, but their `olean`s are not prebuilt in this worktree, so the
four facts actually consumed — the `aeval`-coefficient expansion, the truncation-propagation
lemma, the order-`t` Newton linearization, and the order-0 evaluation identity — are
**restated and reproven locally** here (with namespace `HenselExistence`), so this file
depends only on mathlib. The proofs are line-for-line the asset proofs.
