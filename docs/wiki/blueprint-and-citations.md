# Blueprint and Citations

Use this page when a change is paper-driven, adds a new reference, or changes long-lived
formalization structure.

## Source Of Truth

- [`../../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) is canonical for style, docstrings, naming,
  and citation policy.
- `blueprint/src/` contains blueprint sources.
- `blueprint/web/` and `blueprint/print/` are outputs.
- `BACKGROUND.md` is a lightweight reference list, not the detailed theory source.

## When To Reach For The Blueprint

- New proof systems or other substantial formalization efforts.
- Paper-driven API or design work that spans several files.
- Changes that need shared references, BibTeX entries, or published docs.

For substantial contributions, discuss the blueprint-first workflow described in
[`../../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Citation Workflow

1. Cite papers in Lean docstrings by citation key, for example `[BCIKS20]`.
2. Give the Lean file a `## References` section in its module docstring.
3. Add the matching BibTeX entry to `blueprint/src/references.bib`.
4. For durable paper context, create or update `docs/kb/papers/KEY.md` for the same citation key.
5. Prefer public paper titles, venues, DOIs, or URLs in shared docs rather than pointing readers
   to private or local notes.

## Knowledge Base Mapping

- `blueprint/src/references.bib` is the bibliographic source of truth.
- `docs/kb/papers/KEY.md` is the preferred repository-local landing page for a cited paper key.
- `docs/kb/sources/KEY/metadata.yml` records source provenance and optional local artifacts.
- `docs/kb/_generated/lean-citations.json` is the generated map from Lean files to cited keys.

## Build And Publish Checks

```bash
DISABLE_EQUATIONS=1 lake build ArkLib:docs
./scripts/build-web.sh
```

If blueprint output matters and `leanblueprint` is missing:

```bash
python3 -m pip install leanblueprint
```

### Building the blueprint locally without TeX

`leanblueprint web` (plasTeX) resolves every `\input` through the external `kpsewhich`
binary. On a machine without a TeX distribution the build "succeeds" but every chapter is an
empty ~5KB shell (18 `File not found` warnings) — a vacuous gate. Two fixes:

- Install TeX (what CI does via the `texlive-full` container; `leanblueprint pdf` also needs it).
- Or shim `kpsewhich` with a script that searches `$TEXINPUTS` then the cwd, trying
  `name`, `name.tex`, `name.sty`; put it on `PATH` before running `leanblueprint web`.
  With the shim the local web build produces full chapters (`chap-proof_systems.html` ≈ 300KB,
  not ≈ 5KB) and the genuine content warnings (missing bib keys, unsupported macros) become
  visible. `pip install pygraphviz` needs `brew install graphviz` headers
  (`CFLAGS=-I$(brew --prefix graphviz)/include LDFLAGS=-L$(brew --prefix graphviz)/lib`).

Sanity probe after any blueprint build: `wc -c blueprint/web/chap-*.html` — chapters in the
single-digit-KB range mean the inputs did not resolve and the build was vacuous.
