# The δ* Programme

The mutual-correlated-agreement threshold programme: pin
`δ*(C, ε*) = sup{δ : ε_mca(C, δ) ≤ ε*}` for explicit smooth-domain Reed–Solomon
codes ([ABF26] Definition 4.3), with matching machine-checked bounds.

## Current production checkpoint (2026-09-06)

The research branch `codex/proximity-astra-20260904` now has a
[four-cubic construction](../kb/astra_mca_four_cubic-2026-09-06.md) with
`n+6` distinct MCA-bad scalars on the certified rate-one-half production code,
at radius `335544321/2^30 = 5/16+1/2^30`. The seed arithmetic and counts have
exact Python certificates and independently expanded finite controls. The
complete numerical construction is a written proof; the generic Lean
fresh-direction and original-event bridges do not yet instantiate its fibers
and received word.

Together with the existing full-UDR safety theorem and the Hamming staircase,
the written bracket is
`268435457/2^30 <= deltaStar <= 335544321/2^30`, of width `1/16`.
The lower endpoint is a supremum bound, not an assertion of safety at that
endpoint. In particular, historical proposed universal safety statements
at `1/3` cannot establish this production target. Historical reductions below
must be read with their stated hypotheses, rather than as evidence that a
Paley/BGK result alone completes the present problem.

The eleven supporting Lean lemmas now pass the complete ArkLib CI job in
[run 34042420175](https://github.com/lalalune/ArkLib/actions/runs/34042420175),
with retained [kernel provenance](../../scripts/probes/receipts/astra_root_relocation_lean_20260906/kernel_receipt.json).
Their scope is generic finite choice, the original same-support event, and
count/probability conversion; the numerical production instantiation remains
open.

Three further proof sources are now wired into the same CI gate: the exact
order-eight cubic seed, the production domain's eight fibers and allocation
blocks, and the generic assembly of one received word with an exactly counted
union of ordinary and fresh MCA events. These sources await a successful
kernel run; their addition does not by itself close the production theorem.

The [exact fifth-cubic exclusion](../kb/astra_mca_fifth_cubic_exclusion-2026-09-06.md)
closes one particular extension of this construction. Neither this exclusion
nor the new unsafe bound determines the exact threshold or resolves either
grand challenge. The older
[kernel-checked numerical upper bound](../kb/astra_mca_production_upper-2026-09-05.md)
remains valid with its separate verification scope.

## The fast build path (mandatory)

The ProximityGap cone is 800+ files. **Never iterate with `lake build`** (3000+-job
trace + the build lock serializes all agents). Instead:

```bash
scripts/pg-warm.sh                 # once per session: pre-build substrate oleans
scripts/pg-iterate.sh <file>.lean  # per attempt: ~30-75s, lock-free, parallel-safe
./scripts/lake-locked.sh build <m> # only for full-module olean builds (serialized)
```

Develop in a detached `/tmp` worktree with `.lake` symlinked to the main checkout
(see the agent guide §2 for the concurrency hazards on this shared tree).

## The state in one paragraph

The production conjecture remains open. The granularity ladder gives δ* in closed form on every
band with `3(j−1)+k ≤ n`; exact finite-instance and deep-rung pins, the threshold ledger, the first
explosion-band value, and production brackets are machine checked. The remaining production core
has been reduced to square-root-scale cancellation for the adversarial smooth multiplicative
subgroup (equivalently the deep DC-subtracted-energy/Paley-BGK face). The post-dossier G70 and G73
results close flat-Dudley chaining and Shkredov–Vyugin multi-shift escape routes respectively.
The signed cross-cell `relationAnomaly`/transversality route is the sole recorded off-BGK route not
yet closed; it is tracked in #505. None of the existing toy pins, brackets, equivalences, or no-go
theorems constitutes the production prize theorem.

## The boundary-band solution (2026-06-12, #371 rounds 64–75)

The deepest radius band before capacity (`k < (1−δ)n ≤ k+1`) is **solved
exactly**, and every band of the above-Johnson regime carries proven two-sided
bounds.  The file chain (all axiom-clean, in `ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/`):

| Result | File |
|---|---|
| Bad set = residual-ratio image (exact, both inclusions) | `BoundarySliceExact.lean` |
| Schur-ladder law: ladder bad set = −(subset sums) | `LadderSchurReduction.lean` |
| Master modular reduction: census = arithmetic in `F[X]/P_S` | `ResidualModularReduction.lean` |
| Strong farness is FREE for degree-`k` directions | `BoundarySliceUnconditional.lean` |
| Subset sums = signed sums (antipodal reduction, both ways) | `LadderSpectrumFusion{,Exact}.lean` |
| **Exact ladder count** `= Σ_{a∈A(h,k+1)} 2^a·C(h,a)` | `LadderSpectrumFusionValue.lean` |
| Ladder ≤ spectrum at every radius below capacity | `FullBandLadderLaw.lean` |
| Ratio functionals pairwise distinct (Lagrange/Vandermonde) | `GenericFarSeparation.lean` |
| **Generic-far pin**: `∃ stack, #badSet = C(n,k+1)` (`C(n,k+1)² ≤ q`) | `GenericFarPin.lean` |
| **Universal bound**: `#badSet ≤ C(n,k+1)`, ALL stacks, ALL radii | `UniversalBoundaryBound.lean` |
| Ladder cliff (`= 0` below band) + band packing law | `BandPackingLaw.lean` |
| Band attainment + two-sided bracket at every band | `BandAttainment.lean` |

Solved landscape (final, rounds 64–80): boundary band sup `= C(n,k+1)`
(attained + universal) and production boundary failure `ε_mca ≈ 1`
unconditionally (`ProductionBoundaryFailure.lean`); ladder curve exact at all
radii; band `m ≥ 1` bracketed `[⌊(n−k)/(m+1)⌋, C(n,k+1)/C(k+m+1,k+1)]`
(`BandAttainmentChained.lean`), witness-mass dense (`DeepBandCoherence.lean`),
multiplicity-reduced to the named `ExplainableCoreSupply`
(`DeepBandMultiplicity.lean`) with the supply proven above the wall
(`ExplainableCoreSupplyInstance.lean`).  #371 is CLOSED (consolidated
2026-06-12); the single remaining statement — the sub-Johnson supply wall,
quantitatively the classical RS list-size question — is tracked at **#389**
with the reduction chain and both recorded attack routes.

**2026-06-13 — the shallow supply is two-regime (the two-branch countermodel).**
The universal mean-degree law (`Σ a_c ≤ 2n`) is REFUTED in Lean
(`TwoBranchSupplyCountermodel.lean`, `universalMeanDegreeLaw_REFUTED`): the
two-branch parabola word (`x²` on `A`, `x²+c` on `B`) is agreement-capped by
theorem yet carries `428 > 2n = 160` mass at `(q,n) = (101,80)` — prime field,
`n < q`, no subfield structure.  Corrected named targets:
`CappedSupplyTwoRegimeLaw` (prime, calibrated `C₀ ≤ 1.91`, false over extension
fields by subfield transport) and `SmoothDomainTwoRegimeLaw` (μ_n production
form).  SS13 free-domain asymptotic red-team recorded.

**2026-06-13 — the all-`k` power-word list is exactly a zero-sum fiber.**
`PowerWordListBound.lean` proves the exact list identity
`powerWord_list_eq_sumZero`: for `w(x)=x^(k+1)`, the codewords of `rsCode dom k`
with agreement at least `k+1` are counted exactly by `(k+1)`-subsets of the
domain whose sum is zero.  The proof combines the Vieta coefficient cancellation
`coeff X^k = -ΣT`, the converse root-rigidity argument, and a root-count cap
showing no listed codeword can agree on more than `k+1` points.  This identifies
the `m=0` supply obstruction as a higher zero-sum/additive-energy fiber and links
directly to the `EsymmFiber.lean` deep-band target (`e_1 = ... = e_(m+1) = 0` for
`W=X^(k+m+1)`).  See
