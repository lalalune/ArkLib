# The δ* campaign dossier for #357 — nine hypotheses, two rankings, one queue (2026-06-11)

Companion to issue #357 (the canonical δ* tracker) and to
[`open-math-hypotheses-334-deltastar-2026-06.md`](open-math-hypotheses-334-deltastar-2026-06.md)
(the K1–K5/A1–A5 wave, now mostly landed). This ledger is the next campaign wave: three
*reasonable* hypotheses (existing mathematics used in an unusual way), three *novel* hypotheses
(mathematics that does not yet exist), and three *synthetic* hypotheses (paperworthy connections
between things already in this repository), each preceded by the honest exposition the
per-hypothesis discipline demands, then ranked on two axes and attacked in score order.

Everything below respects the #357 conventions: probes precede formalization, refutations land in
`DISPROOF_LOG.md` as sorry-free lemmas, open cores stay named Props, and any δ* claim must arrive
as two `mcaDeltaStar` bracket instantiations (`le_mcaDeltaStar_of_good` /
`mcaDeltaStar_le_of_bad`) that **meet**.

## 0. The problem, and why it is hard

**The problem.** For explicit smooth-domain Reed–Solomon codes `C = RS[F, L, k]` (`L` a
multiplicative subgroup of size `n = 2^μ`, rate `ρ = k/n` fixed, `|F| < 2^256`,
`ε* = 2^-128`), pin the mutual-correlated-agreement threshold
`δ*(C, ε*) = sup {δ : ε_mca(C, δ) ≤ ε*}` with **matching** upper and lower bounds. After the
2025–26 wave the window is `δ* ∈ (1−√ρ, 1−ρ−Θ_ρ(1/log n))`: the Johnson edge is held by full
MCA (BCGM25/Hab25/BCHKS25), the capacity edge is destroyed (CS25/KK25/DG25) and the near-capacity
strip is excluded by KKH26/Kambiré. Everything formalizable from the literature is formalized
in-tree; what remains is new mathematics.

**Why it is hard — the three structural walls.**

1. **The coupling wall.** CS25/BCHKS25 prove that any `ε_mca ≤ ε*` bound past Johnson for these
   codes *yields beyond-Johnson list decoding of explicit RS codes* — a ~25-year-old open
   problem. The lower-bracket side of the window is therefore at least as hard as a notorious
   open problem in coding theory. This is not folklore; the reduction is machine-mirrored
   in-tree (`Connections/ListDecodingAndCA.lean`, `EpsMCAInterleaved*.lean`).
2. **The average→worst-case wall.** Every counting/moment technique (second moment, fourth
   moment, Paley–Zygmund, Fisher) bounds the *average* list size over received words, and the
   average is provably fine well past Johnson; but `ε_mca` is a `sup` over stacks, and the sup
   escapes every moment of constant order. The wall is formal:
   `JohnsonSecondMomentFrontier.lean`, `JohnsonFourthMomentNoGo.lean`,
   `FisherPastJohnsonCap.lean`.
3. **The structure/randomness wall.** Capacity-achieving list decoding *exists* for random
   punctured RS (GZ23/GG25) and folded RS/subspace designs (CZ25/JLR26) — but every known proof
   consumes randomness or folding precisely where the smooth domain offers structure instead.
   No derandomization is known; the M3 probe campaign showed the smooth domain is *measurably
   different* from random domains (third agreement moment, pencil census) — so the answer for
   smooth domains may genuinely differ from the random ensemble, and nothing in the literature
   can currently see that difference.

**What the latest research says (June 2026 sweeps, PDFs read end-to-end).** No edge-movers
beyond the table in #357 §1. Chai–Fan 858/861 are protocol-level (sidestep `ε_mca`); the
random-RS line is ensemble-only; the explicit-subspace-design line (ECCC TR26-057/058/074)
is the nearest active thread to a derandomization. ABF26 (2026/680) is the survey of record
and its §5 "collapse" question (does interleaved list decoding control MCA?) is exactly the
open seam of the in-tree LD⇔MCA dictionary.

**The most promising open directions** (from #357 §5, unchanged by this sweep): the exact-point
programme (nobody anywhere has an exact δ* for *any* code), fold/tower transport of the KKH26
ceiling, the census/moments channel (the only domain-separating invariant known), the
syndrome-space lens (Yuan–Zhu for random linear codes; the probes' syndrome reduction is the
same change of coordinates), additive-combinatorial inverse theorems for bad families, and the
threshold-halving fixpoint question.

**Broad unimplemented ideas this dossier draws on, and why they are unimplemented:**

- *Exact computation as theorem-ware.* The literature only ever bounds `ε_mca`; the idea of
  proving exact values (and exact δ* points) machine-checked, then scaling the orbit theory,
  exists nowhere because no other group has both a formal `ε_mca` and an exact-arithmetic probe
  lab. Refutation risk: kernel-`decide` cost explodes at n ≥ 8; mitigated by equivariance.
- *Dual-syndrome geometry.* MCA events depend on stacks only through their syndromes; the dual
  of smooth-domain RS is again (generalized) RS, so the bad-γ census is a statement about the
  joint weight distribution of a GRS code. Nobody has pushed this because the syndrome
  reduction was discovered here (probe infrastructure) and Yuan–Zhu's syndrome-space argument
  is tuned to *random* parity checks. Refutation risk: the worst-case sup may not be
  syndrome-spectrum-controlled beyond toy scale.
- *Inverse/structure theorems.* All known bad families (CS25, KK25, KKH26, prime-field) are
  coset/orbit-structured; additive combinatorics has machinery (Bogolyubov–Ruzsa, Sanders) for
  "large additive structure ⟹ coset structure" that has never been imported into proximity
  gaps. Why not: the communities are disjoint, and the bad-family object (sets of γ with
  per-γ-varying witness sets) is not yet phrased as a sumset object. Refutation risk: the
  witness-set freedom may admit genuinely unstructured bad families; the
  `unique_bad_gamma_common_witness` obstruction shows witness variation is *mandatory*, which
  cuts both ways.
- *Symmetry quotients of the MCA functional.* `ε_mca` is invariant under a large group
  (domain rotation × codeword translation × scaling × γ-shift); nobody computes with the
  quotient because nobody computes `ε_mca` at all. The flat-numerator phenomenon (bad count
  exactly `n` at every field at (12,6)) smells like an orbit count. Refutation risk: the
  invariance is easy; the danger is that the quotient explains the *numerator* but not the
  *sup*.

## 1. The reasonable slate (existing mathematics, used insightfully)

**Exposition.** The bracket engine (`MCAThresholdLedger.lean`) makes δ* a real number pinched
between proven good points and proven bad points. Today the brackets are asymptotic bands; no
*exact* value of `mcaDeltaStar` has ever been certified for any code, by anyone, in any proof
format. Meanwhile two cheap structured moves on the ceiling side (fold transport, iteration of
the 858 halving map) are sitting unexplored with all of their inputs already formalized. None
of these three requires new mathematics — each requires noticing that in-tree objects already
compose.

### R1 — The first machine-checked exact δ* point: `mcaDeltaStar(RS[F₅, F₅*, 2], 2/5) = 1/4`
- **Constraints.** `epsMCA` is an `iSup` over `5^8` stacks of a `Pr` over `γ`; kernel `decide`
  cannot brute-force that, and `mcaEvent`'s cardinality clause lives in `ℝ≥0` (not decidable).
- **The insight.** Two reductions kill the whole cost. (i) For `δ < 1/n`-granularity radii the
  witness set is *forced to be all of `ι`*, and then badness of two distinct scalars is
  algebraically contradictory for **any** submodule code (subtract the two codeword lines:
  `(γ−γ')•u₁ ∈ C ⟹ u₁ ∈ C ⟹ u₀ ∈ C ⟹ pairJointAgreesOn univ`) — so `ε_mca ≤ 1/|F|` with **no
  computation at all**, for every linear code, generalizing `MCAZeroCodeExact`'s ZMod-2-specific
  bound. (ii) The bad side needs only **one explicit stack**; the probe supplies
  `u₀ = (0,0,0,1)`, `u₁ = (0,0,1,1)` on `G = (1,2,4,3) ⊂ F₅` with 4 of 5 scalars bad at
  `δ = 1/4` — a tiny `decide` after an iff-bridge replacing the `ℝ≥0` clause by `3 ≤ S.card`.
- **Exact ground truth (probe, exact arithmetic, two-engine validated):** at RS[F₅,4,2],
  `ε_mca(δ) = 1/5` on `[0, 1/4)` and `4/5` on `[1/4, 1]` — a pure step function. With
  `ε* = 2/5`: `mcaGoodRadii = [0, 1/4)`, so `δ* = 1/4` **exactly** (and the sup is not
  attained — a worked example that δ* can sit at a jump).
- **Why nobody has done it.** Papers bound `ε_mca`; they never compute it. An exact δ* theorem
  requires a formal `ε_mca`, a bracket engine, and an exact probe lab in one place — only this
  repo has all three.
- **Larp-check.** Grep confirms no `mcaDeltaStar … = …` equality theorem in-tree; the ledger
  file itself marks the exact-point candidate OPEN. The probe numbers above were recomputed
  this session from the syndrome-reduced engine and cross-checked against the naive engine.
- **Interesting because:** δ* = 1/4 = (1−ρ)/2 here — at toy scale with this `ε*`, δ* *is* the
  unique-decoding radius; the first data point of the "where in the window does δ* actually
  sit" curve, and the template (forced-witness algebra + explicit stack + sSup assembly) scales
  by orbit reduction to the n = 8 rung.
- **Refutation surface.** None mathematical (the values are exact); the risk is purely
  formalization cost.

### R2 — Fold transport: the KKH26 ceiling is not fold-invariant and strictly shrinks down the tower
- **Constraints.** The KKH26 bad-line family lives at one smooth scale `n = 2^μ`; the smooth
  tower `L → L² → …` (the FRI fold) maps RS[F, L, k] data to RS[F, L², k/2] data. In-tree:
  the full KKH26 surface (§2.2 of #357) and the fold algebra (FRI lane).
- **Hypothesis.** The fold image of the KKH26 bad family is *not* a KKH26-shaped bad family at
  the folded scale; quantitatively, one fold step strictly shrinks the bad-scalar census, so
  the ceiling transported down a μ-tower is strictly stronger than the per-scale ceiling — a
  μ-uniform improvement of `kkh26_mcaDeltaStar_le`.
- **Why nobody:** KKH26 is a one-scale construction; fold-equivariance questions only arise in
  the FRI context this repo formalizes.
- **Larp-check:** no fold-invariance statement exists in KKH26 or in-tree (grep).
- **Falsifier (cheap, run first).** Fold the explicit bad line at the smallest KKH26-admissible
  tower and count: if the census is fold-stable, R2 dies and (by the mutual-falsification
  pairing) census-extremality of the KKH26 family survives — either way a brick lands.
- **Interesting because:** it is the only known route to making the ceiling *rate-aware inside
  one code family* rather than per-(n, ρ) — and any strictness result immediately re-prices
  the `Θ_ρ(1/log n)` strip.

### R3 — The threshold-halving fixpoint band: iterate the Chai–Fan map and see where it converges
- **Constraints.** Loop42 (`ProofLoop42.lean`) formalizes the 858 device: a verified map
  `T : (δ, ε) ↦ (δ', ε/2)` improving FRI soundness *by avoiding* `ε_mca`. 858 applies `T`
  once. In-tree also: the `1−ρ^{2/3}` interval-admissibility brick.
- **Hypothesis.** Either (a) `T`-iteration exits the window in O(1) steps (a verified no-go
  lemma: the halving device cannot band δ*), or (b) the fixpoint of the δ-component pins a
  sub-band of the window, with exponent linked to the `1−ρ^{2/3}` brick. Exactly one of (a)/(b)
  holds; both are landable bricks.
- **Why nobody:** 858 is 4 months old and its authors needed one application; nobody asked the
  dynamical question.
- **Larp-check:** `ProofLoop42.lean` ends after a single application (read this session);
  no iteration analysis exists anywhere.
- **Falsifier:** arithmetic only — compute the orbit of `(δ₀, ε*)` under `T` symbolically at
  the production rates; an O(1) exit is itself the (a)-brick.
- **Interesting because:** it would be the first *protocol-side* constraint on where δ* can
  matter (even a negative answer sharpens what the prize is for), at nearly zero cost.

**Most promising of the three: R1** — it is the only one guaranteed to land an unconditional
theorem that exists nowhere else, and its equivariance follow-on (S3) is the scaling engine for
every future exact rung.

## 2. The novel slate (mathematics that does not exist yet)

**Exposition.** The three walls in §0 say: moments can't see the sup, the literature can't see
the domain, and the lower bracket is hostage to a 25-year-old problem. The novel slate attacks
each wall at its specific weak point. What is genuinely new: (i) no proven statement anywhere
*distinguishes* smooth domains from random domains in any window-relevant statistic — yet the
probes show the distinction is real and localized (the pencil census, the normalizer spike,
the spectral gap); (ii) no one has ever written the MCA event in dual/syndrome coordinates as
a *proof device* for explicit codes; (iii) no one has ever asked whether bad families are
*forced* to be structured. Each idea is built on verified probe phenomena or on a formalized
reduction already in-tree, has a likely refutation channel we can name (and test cheaply), and
is non-obvious precisely because the relevant communities (additive combinatorics, algebraic
curves over finite fields, lattice/syndrome coding theory) have never been pointed at `ε_mca`.

### N1 — The structured-counterexamples-only conjecture (inverse theorem for window bad families)
- **Statement (informal).** Over a smooth domain, any line family witnessing
  `ε_mca(C, δ) > ε*` for `δ` in the window is `poly(1/ε*)`-covered by affine/subgroup-structured
  families (cosets of multiplicative subgroups in the γ-coordinate, orbit-structured witness
  sets) — i.e. the CS25/KK25/KKH26/prime-field shapes are the **only** shapes.
- **Built on:** every known counterexample being coset/orbit-structured (formalized guardrails
  §2.7 of #357); Bogolyubov–Ruzsa/Sanders inverse machinery; the K4 window law (Lam–Leung) as
  the Fourier-side first step, already partially in-tree (`LamLeungMultisetAntipodal.lean`,
  `PrimePowerMultisetWindow.lean`).
- **Why it doesn't exist:** the bad-family object has never been phrased as a sumset object;
  the witness-set freedom looks unstructured until `unique_bad_gamma_common_witness` (in-tree)
  is used to channel it.
- **What's new:** if true, the window bracket becomes *computable by enumeration of structured
  families* — δ* stops being an analytic unknown and becomes a (large) finite check; even a
  partial version (structure at `ε ≥ n^{-O(1)}`) would move the ceiling.
- **Likely refutation and why it's not obvious:** a "random sparse" bad family with
  pseudo-random witness spread would kill it; but the DEEP-quotient transfer says such a family
  yields an unstructured large list-decoding configuration — which would itself be a
  breakthrough against the 25-year wall. So refutation is *as hard as progress*, which is the
  hallmark of a well-posed structure conjecture.
- **First brick:** the formal reduction "structured cover ⟹ enumerable bracket"
  (unconditional), plus an exhaustive toy census: enumerate ALL bad families at RS[F₅,4,2] and
  RS[F₇·…] rungs and *measure* their structure — if even toy scale shows unstructured bad
  families, N1 dies immediately and cheaply.

### N2 — The dual-syndrome spectral attack: `ε_mca` as a joint-weight statement about a GRS code
- **Statement.** The MCA event depends on `(u₀, u₁)` only through the syndrome pair
  `(s₀, s₁) ∈ (F^{n−k})²` (formal: `epsMCA = sup` over syndrome classes — the probes' reduction,
  promoted to a theorem); the dual of smooth-domain RS is generalized RS, so the bad-γ census
  is controlled by the joint weight enumerator of an explicit GRS code. Conjectured
  consequence: the flat-numerator law (max bad count `= n`, field-independent, at (12,6)) is a
  MacWilliams-type identity, and the numerator stays `poly(n)` through a strip past Johnson.
- **Built on:** the probes' syndrome reduction (the thing that makes exact `ε_mca` computable);
  Yuan–Zhu's syndrome-space proximity gaps for random linear codes (arXiv:2605.07595); the
  smooth-domain dual-code structure (in-tree RS duality bricks).
- **Why it doesn't exist:** Yuan–Zhu's argument uses randomness of the parity-check matrix
  exactly where smooth RS offers Vandermonde/character structure; nobody has replaced the
  probabilistic step with character sums.
- **What's new:** the first proof device aimed at the *sup* (wall 2) rather than the average —
  the sup over syndrome classes is a finite geometric object (orbits of GRS syndromes), not a
  probabilistic one.
- **Likely refutation:** the sup may concentrate on syndrome classes whose joint weight
  behaviour is no better than worst-case; testable at toy scale (the probe lab already stores
  per-class censuses).
- **First brick:** the syndrome-factorization theorem `epsMCA_eq_syndrome_sup` (pure linear
  algebra, unconditional, and a probe-soundness theorem retroactively certifying the entire
  exact-ladder programme).

### N3 — The pencil spectral-gap theorem: the M3 domain separation becomes proof
- **Statement.** For the smooth subgroup domain at `q ≳ n²`, every non-normalizer degree-3
  pencil has 2-fiber count `t₂ = O(n²/q + 1)` (Weil on the (1,1)-curve
  `φ₀xy − φ₁(x+y) + φ₂ = 0` against subgroup characters), so the pencil spectrum has a
  certified gap: noise band `O(n²/q+1)`, normalizer band `{(n−2)/2, n/2}` — making the probes'
  M3 separation (smooth ≠ random, measured at 3.4–14× cloud diameter) a theorem, the **first
  proven domain-separating invariant inside the window statistics**.
- **Built on:** the machine-verified spike law (normalizer pencils exactly
  `{x ↦ c/x} ∪ {x ↦ −x}`, probes at (41,10),(113,16),(257,16)); in-tree Stepanov/Weil bricks
  (`weil-hasse-multiplicity-bridge` lane); the MSS CJM-2018 Cor 4.1 energy line.
- **Why it doesn't exist:** the pencil census was discovered here three days ago; the Weil
  input is standard but has never been pointed at fiber statistics of agreement moments.
- **What's new:** wall 3 (structure/randomness) gets its first theorem: a *provable* statistic
  that any derandomization or any transfer of random-ensemble results must respect. If δ* for
  smooth domains differs from the random-domain value, the separating mechanism plausibly
  factors through exactly this invariant.
- **Likely refutation:** none for the gap itself (Weil is unconditional); the risk is
  *irrelevance* — the honest A3 quantification says ΔM3 ~ q^{-4}, perhaps forever invisible at
  `ε* = 2^-128`. The non-obvious part is that irrelevance is not yet provable either: no
  in-window bound is census-blind-certified.
- **First brick:** the character-sum estimate for one non-normalizer pencil family at toy
  scale, cross-checked against the stored spectra; then the general `t₂` bound as a named
  theorem consuming the in-tree Weil interface.

**Most promising of the three: N2.** It is the only attack pointed directly at the
average→worst-case wall with an unconditional first brick (the factorization theorem) that is
useful even if the conjecture half fails, and it retroactively certifies the probe lab.

---

## 3. The synthetic slate (paperworthy connections inside the repo)

**Exposition.** Three families of artifacts grew independently in this tree: the KKH26
root-of-unity census (#334 lane), the de Bruijn/Lam–Leung vanishing-sum classification (#232
lane) plus `WitnessLayerCount`, and the orbit/equivariance phenomena in the probe lab (syndrome
reduction, affine invariance of all moments, flat numerators). The LD⇔MCA dictionary likewise
has two halves (upper: `EpsMCAInterleaved*`; lower: `DeepQuotientTransfer`) that have never
been stated as one object. Each connection below is a unification that (a) is checkable now,
(b) produces at least one new theorem not derivable from either side alone, and (c) is the
kind of statement a survey like ABF26 would cite as a structural contribution.

### S1 — One sum-polynomial API: KKH26 census ≡ de Bruijn vanishing sums ≡ witness-layer count
- **The connection.** KKH26 bad scalars are sums of roots of unity; distinctness = resultant
  non-vanishing; the #232 de Bruijn machinery classifies *vanishing* sums at prime powers
  (antipodal pairs only — Lam–Leung); `WitnessLayerCount.lean` counts balanced exponent sets.
  These are the same mathematics with three APIs.
- **The new theorem it buys:** the cross-stratum census *closed form* at all prime powers (the
  probes' "general rung law", currently empirical with a blind n=64 forecast verified by two
  independent enumerations) — formalizable once the three artifacts share one
  "sum-polynomial" structure; the stratified-spread ceiling then gets exact constants instead
  of inequalities.
- **Why paperworthy:** it identifies the *combinatorial kernel of the KKH26 ceiling* as the
  classical vanishing-sums-of-roots-of-unity theory (Conway–Jones, Lam–Leung), which neither
  KKH26 nor any successor noticed; the per-prime falsifier (O134: +11/+54 spurious words at
  n=64) then has a clean home as the `p | N(α)` correction layer.
- **Refutation surface:** the cross-stratum injectivity might genuinely need thresholds the
  unified API can't carry; the O134 surplus already bounds how clean the law can be — the
  unification must *predict* the surplus mechanism, a falsifiable claim.

### S2 — The LD⇔MCA dictionary as a Galois connection: one ledger for both prize quantities
- **The connection.** Upper half: interleaved list bounds ⟹ MCA bounds
  (`EpsMCAInterleavedList`, GCXK25 wrappers). Lower half: list lower bounds ⟹ MCA lower bounds
  (`DeepQuotientTransfer`). Together: `ε_mca ≈ |Λ(C^{≡2}, δ)|/q` within explicit factors. The
  synthetic claim: state this as an order-adjunction between the profile `δ ↦ |Λ(δ)|` and
  `δ ↦ ε_mca(δ)` and prove the **bracket-interpolation theorem**: the `mcaDeltaStar` brackets
  meet iff the list-profile brackets meet, with the gap between the two δ*'s bounded by the
  dictionary's explicit factors.
- **The new theorem it buys:** the two companion prize quantities (#357 §1 names both)
  provably collapse to *one* number up to an explicit, formalized error — every future brick
  automatically lands in both ledgers, and the "collapse" question of ABF26 §5 gets a precise
  in-tree form (which factor must improve, by how much, to make the dictionary lossless past
  Johnson).
- **Why paperworthy:** ABF26 poses the collapse informally; nobody has the two halves formal
  in one place to even state the adjunction.
- **Refutation surface:** the adjunction inequalities might be too lossy to be interesting
  (factor q in the wrong place); the interpolation theorem's statement forces us to compute
  the loss exactly — if it's vacuous, that *is* the measured statement of why B4 is hard.

### S3 — The equivariance engine: one group action under which everything so far is invariant
- **The connection.** Four independently-discovered phenomena — the probes' syndrome
  reduction (codeword translation), the M3 affine/coset invariance (`p ↦ p(ax+b)`), the KKH26
  rotation orbits, and the γ-shift used in the exact ladder — are the statement that
  `mcaEvent` is equivariant under one group
  `G = (domain rotation) ⋉ (codeword translation × scalar scaling × γ-affine reparam)`,
  and `ε_mca` descends to the double-coset space of stacks.
- **The new theorems it buys:** (i) `mcaEvent_rotate` / `mcaEvent_translate` /
  `epsMCA_eq_sup_orbitReps` — the formal quotient, making the n=8 exact rung
  kernel-`decide`-able (the R1 scaling engine) and the n=12, p=37 probe rung feasible
  (~factor n·(p−1) speedup); (ii) the **flat-numerator explanation**: the bad-γ numerator at
  (12,6) equal to exactly `n` at every field is an orbit count of a single G-orbit — a
  falsifiable closed-form claim; (iii) retroactive soundness of every orbit-reduced probe.
- **Why paperworthy:** "the MCA functional has a large symmetry group and its exact values
  are orbit counts" is a structural observation absent from all of BCIKS20→ABF26; it is also
  the only known organizing principle for *exact* δ* data.
- **Refutation surface:** the invariance lemmas are certain; the flat-numerator-as-orbit-count
  claim is the falsifiable half (the (12,6) census across three fields is already stored —
  check whether the 12 bad lines form one orbit; if not, the explanation dies while the
  engine survives).

**Most promising of the three: S3** — it is load-bearing for R1's scaling, certifies the probe
lab, and its falsifiable half (orbit-count law) is checkable today against stored data.

## 4. The two rankings and the queue

Ease of proof/refutation (easiest first):

| rank | hyp | why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | R1 | all inputs verified this session; pure algebra + tiny decide |
| 2 | R3 | symbolic arithmetic on a formalized map |
| 3 | S3 | invariance lemmas are routine; falsifier data already stored |
| 4 | R2 | one fold computation on an explicit family |
| 5 | N3 | Weil input standard; in-tree interface exists; toy cross-check stored |
| 6 | S1 | three APIs exist; unification is engineering + one new injectivity |
| 7 | N2 | factorization theorem routine; the spectral conjecture is open-ended |
| 8 | S2 | both halves exist; the loss computation may be long |
| 9 | N1 | genuine new structure theory; refutation as hard as progress |

Promise toward actually pinning δ* (most promising first):

| rank | hyp | why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | N1 | if true, δ* becomes enumerable — the only full-pin candidate |
| 2 | N2 | only attack aimed at the sup/worst-case wall |
| 3 | S2 | merges both prize quantities; quantifies the collapse |
| 4 | R2 | strict ceiling improvement inside the window |
| 5 | N3 | first provable domain separation — feeds any derandomization |
| 6 | S3 | scaling engine for exact data; explains flat numerators |
| 7 | S1 | exact constants for the ceiling census |
| 8 | R1 | toy-scale, but the first exact point anywhere |
| 9 | R3 | likely a no-go brick, but cheap and clarifying |

Combined score (rank-sum, lower better): **R1+S3 (9) → N2 (9) → R2 (8)** … the queue:

**R1 → S3 → R2 → N3 → R3 → S1 → N2 → S2 → N1** — with R1/S3 first (R1 is rank-1 ease and S3
is its scaling engine; together they produce the campaign's first unconditional theorem),
then alternating ceiling work (R2, S1) with the wall attacks (N3, N2), and the two
open-research conjectures (S2, N1) carried probe-first throughout.

Per the discipline: every refutation lands in `DISPROOF_LOG.md` with a sorry-free constraint
lemma; anything proven that cannot be refuted gets promoted into the bracket ledger; if the
whole slate dies, the next slate is generated from what the refutations taught.
