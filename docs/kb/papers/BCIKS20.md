# BCIKS20

## At A Glance

`BCIKS20` is the core reference for ArkLib's current Reed-Solomon proximity-gap development.
It is the central paper behind the `Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap` subtree and also appears in
supporting formalizations around list decoding, Guruswami-Sudan ingredients, and rational-function
machinery.

## What ArkLib Uses From This Paper

- The main proximity-gap and correlated-agreement statements formalized under
  [`ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/Basic.lean`](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/Basic.lean)
  and the `BCIKS20/` subtree.
- Supporting list-decoding ingredients formalized under
  [`ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/ListDecoding/`](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/ListDecoding).
- Appendix-style rational-function infrastructure in
  [`ArkLib/Data/Polynomial/RationalFunctions.lean`](../../../ArkLib/Data/Polynomial/RationalFunctions.lean).

## Main ArkLib Touchpoints

- [`ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/Basic.lean`](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/Basic.lean)
  defines the reusable proximity-gap and correlated-agreement interfaces.
- [`ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/ReedSolomonGap.lean`](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/ReedSolomonGap.lean)
  contains the Reed-Solomon gap theorem layer.
- [`ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/AffineLines/Main.lean`](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/AffineLines/Main.lean)
  and
  [`ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/AffineSpaces.lean`](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/AffineSpaces.lean)
  hold the main correlated-agreement directions.
- [`ArkLib/ProofSystem/Stir/ProximityGap.lean`](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/Stir/ProximityGap.lean)
  reuses this line of theory in protocol-level work.
- [`ArkLib/ProofSystem/BatchedFri/Security.lean`](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/BatchedFri/Security.lean)
  cites specific claims from the paper in a proof-system security context.
- [`ArkLib/ProofSystem/BatchedFri/QueryRoundProbability.lean`](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/BatchedFri/QueryRoundProbability.lean)
  and
  [`ArkLib/ProofSystem/BatchedFri/QueryRoundAnalysis.lean`](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/BatchedFri/QueryRoundAnalysis.lean)
  contain the proved query-round probability/density pieces feeding the Claim 8.2 frontier.
- [`ArkLib/ProofSystem/BatchedFri/QueryRoundSoundness.lean`](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/BatchedFri/QueryRoundSoundness.lean),
  [`ArkLib/ProofSystem/BatchedFri/QueryRoundRSAffineLineSoundness.lean`](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/BatchedFri/QueryRoundRSAffineLineSoundness.lean),
  [`ArkLib/ProofSystem/BatchedFri/QueryRoundRSCurveSoundness.lean`](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/BatchedFri/QueryRoundRSCurveSoundness.lean),
  and
  [`ArkLib/ProofSystem/BatchedFri/QuerySoundnessSmallField.lean`](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/BatchedFri/QuerySoundnessSmallField.lean)
  expose density/probability adapters, Reed-Solomon affine-line and curve routes, and
  small-field/vacuous-regime consequences.
- [`blueprint/src/proof_systems/fri.tex`](../../../blueprint/src/proof_systems/fri.tex)
  now records the Claim 8.2/8.3 split frontiers and their coding-theory prerequisites.

## Known Divergences From ArkLib

- ArkLib often packages the mathematics through reusable coding-theory abstractions rather than the
  exact paper statement shape.
- Some paper concepts are represented indirectly through general interfaces instead of a dedicated
  symbol matching the paper's notation.
- Some development branches tied to this paper still contain proof gaps or incomplete branches; see
  dedicated audit pages for exact status.

## Open Formalization Gaps

- Keep persistent theorem/status matrices in audit pages rather than overloading this landing page.
  The Appendix A rational-function layer is tracked in
  [`../audits/bciks20-appendix-a-rational-functions.md`](../audits/bciks20-appendix-a-rational-functions.md).
- Record when paper-level statements are only represented through more abstract ArkLib interfaces.
- Batched-FRI Claim 8.2 has proved query-round and oracle-lens pieces, but the general
  correlated-agreement-to-joint-agreement bridge remains an explicit proof obligation except for
  specialized Reed-Solomon routes and small-field/vacuous regimes.
- Batched-FRI Claim 8.3 has split query-lift, sequential-composition, and total-error-accounting
  frontiers; unconditional closure still needs the relevant phase soundness/error-bound inputs.
- Revisit once the existing paper audit is migrated or mirrored under `docs/kb/audits/`.
