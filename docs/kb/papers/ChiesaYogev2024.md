# ChiesaYogev2024

## At A Glance

`ChiesaYogev2024` is the textbook reference for building cryptographic proofs from hash
functions. ArkLib cites it in the oracle-reduction layer, especially around the BCS transform and
Fiat-Shamir treatment.

## What ArkLib Uses From This Paper

- Background for the BCS transformation from oracle reductions to ordinary reductions.
- Conceptual guidance for the hash-function and Fiat-Shamir layers used by ArkLib's oracle
  reduction framework.

## Main ArkLib Touchpoints

- [`ArkLib/OracleReduction/BCS/Basic.lean`](../../../ArkLib/OracleReduction/BCS/Basic.lean)
  cites this textbook alongside the original BCS16 IOP reference.
- [`ArkLib/OracleReduction/FiatShamir/Basic.lean`](../../../ArkLib/OracleReduction/FiatShamir/Basic.lean)
  states that the formalization mostly follows this treatment.
- [`docs/kb/concepts/oracle-reductions.md`](../concepts/oracle-reductions.md) records this book as
  background for ArkLib's oracle-reduction architecture.
