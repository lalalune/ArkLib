# KZG10TR

## At A Glance

`KZG10TR` is the extended technical report version of the KZG paper. ArkLib cites it for the
evaluation-binding reduction because this version includes the security proofs.

## What ArkLib Uses From This Paper

- The evaluation-binding security argument for KZG polynomial commitments.
- The reduction from a successful two-opening adversary to the `t`-SDH assumption.

## Main ArkLib Touchpoints

- [`ArkLib/CommitmentScheme/KZG/Binding.lean`](../../../ArkLib/CommitmentScheme/KZG/Binding.lean)
  cites `KZG10TR` directly.

## Version Notes

- This page tracks CACR technical report 2010-10.
- The ASIACRYPT 2010 proceedings version is tracked separately as `KZG10`.

## Open Formalization Gaps

- The current page is a lightweight landing page. A fuller audit should map the proof lemmas in
  `Binding.lean` to the extended-version proof structure.
