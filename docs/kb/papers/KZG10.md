# KZG10

## At A Glance

`KZG10` is the ASIACRYPT paper introducing the KZG polynomial commitment scheme used by ArkLib's
core KZG definitions.

## What ArkLib Uses From This Paper

- The constant-size polynomial commitment construction.
- The commit, open, and verify operations instantiated in `Basic.lean`.

## Main ArkLib Touchpoints

- [`ArkLib/CommitmentScheme/KZG/Basic.lean`](../../../ArkLib/CommitmentScheme/KZG/Basic.lean)
  cites `KZG10` directly.

## Version Notes

- This page tracks the ASIACRYPT 2010 proceedings version currently recorded in `references.bib`.
- The extended technical report is tracked separately as `KZG10TR`.

## Open Formalization Gaps

- The current page is a lightweight landing page. A fuller audit should record which paper notation
  corresponds to each concrete definition in `Basic.lean`.
