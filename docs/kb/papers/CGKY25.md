# CGKY25

## At A Glance

`CGKY25` is the reference used by ArkLib's KZG function-binding reduction. The relevant portion is
the ARSDH-style extraction argument for functional commitments.

## What ArkLib Uses From This Paper

- The case split used by `mapFunctionBindingInstanceToArsdhInstAux`.
- The ARSDH target instance assembled by the KZG function-binding reduction.

## Main ArkLib Touchpoints

- [`ArkLib/CommitmentScheme/KZG/FunctionBinding/Basic.lean`](../../../ArkLib/CommitmentScheme/KZG/FunctionBinding/Basic.lean)
  cites `CGKY25` directly.

## Version Notes

- This page tracks the ePrint version currently recorded in `references.bib`.

## Open Formalization Gaps

- The current page is a lightweight landing page. A fuller audit should record which steps of the
  paper reduction correspond to each major lemma in `FunctionBinding/Basic.lean`.
