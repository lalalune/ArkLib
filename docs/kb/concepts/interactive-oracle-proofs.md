# Interactive Oracle Proofs

This page is the KB landing page for IOP-related terminology as it appears in ArkLib.

## Scope

Use this page when a question is about:

- the relationship between IOPs and ArkLib's `OracleReduction` abstractions;
- why `VectorIOR` exists as a specialization;
- where the repo points to the original IOP literature.

For the architecture of the interactive-oracle-reduction layer itself (prover/verifier interaction
model, oracle verifiers and the `embed` mechanism, execution semantics, security definitions, and
composition), see the companion concept page
[`oracle-reductions.md`](oracle-reductions.md).

## Core References

- [`../papers/BCS16.md`](../papers/BCS16.md) - current landing page for the original IOP
  reference key used in ArkLib.

## Main ArkLib Touchpoints

- [`../../../ArkLib/OracleReduction/Basic.lean`](../../../ArkLib/OracleReduction/Basic.lean)
- [`../../../ArkLib/OracleReduction/VectorIOR.lean`](../../../ArkLib/OracleReduction/VectorIOR.lean)

## Notes

- ArkLib's `OracleReduction` abstraction is broader than the original vector-IOP formulation.
- This concept page is for orientation and cross-linking; detailed paper metadata belongs on the
  paper page.
