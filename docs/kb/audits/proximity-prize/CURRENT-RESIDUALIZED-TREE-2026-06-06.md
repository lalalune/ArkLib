# ArkLib residualized tree audit snapshot (2026-06-06)

This is a source-map snapshot for the proximity-prize audit notes in this ArkLib checkout, not a
live GitHub issue-status ledger. Older notes in this directory preserve campaign history and may
mention old raw-hole line numbers such as `Curves.lean:1819`; treat those as historical
breadcrumbs, not current locations.

## Current shape

The live ArkLib tree mostly exposes unfinished work as named residual APIs, explicit hypothesis
bundles, documentation-only roadmap notes, or opaque stand-ins. The old "single raw sorry at a line"
framing is no longer accurate for the BCIKS20/FRI/STIR/WHIR proximity-gap campaign.

## Historical tracking issue map

Use focused GitHub issues as the active work index. The tables below preserve the campaign issue
map from the first and second audit passes; their `State` cells are historical and may be stale
after later issue splits such as #64-#75. For live ownership, run:

```sh
gh issue list -R lalalune/ArkLib --state open --limit 100
gh issue list -R lalalune/ArkLib --state all --limit 200 --json number,title,state
```

## Grand Challenges

The prize Grand Challenges remain open research, tracked separately from the residual buckets
above. Distinguish four kinds of grand-challenge work when claiming or filing issues:

* **Collapsed real-threshold predicates** — the formal Grand MCA / Grand LD statements whose
  real-number thresholds were collapsed to predicate form during residualization; see #55 for the
  missing MCA-attainment counterpart / stale-reference repair.
* **Faithful lattice threshold values** — replacing collapsed predicates with faithful
  lattice-encoded threshold values: canonical bridges between singular and plural lattice
  encodings (#58), and discharging the numeric Johnson/Elias certificates at the faithful
  thresholds (#56).
* **Radius-one middle-band extremal count** — the exact bad-scalar extremal count in the
  remaining middle band for radius one (#39); the boundary `mu_8` list-of-three witness already
  landed.
* **Concrete four-rate MCA/LD lattice instantiation** — instantiating faithful lattice-threshold
  brackets at the four prize rates for Grand MCA (#57) and the matching Grand LD certificates
  (#56).

The post-refutation value state (after the RIM/AGL24 derandomization counterexample, #40/#41) is
documented in the repo alongside the counterexample formalization; the dead derandomization route
is formalized so it cannot regress.

## Historical notes

The following notes are retained for provenance but are not current inventories. Where an old
note says "issues #6-#23", read it as "the issue map in this index", which now extends through
the grand-challenge second pass (#39-#59):

* `GRIND-LEDGER.md` records the June 5 bottom-up campaign and still contains old
  `Curves.lean:1819` breadcrumbs.
* `integration-2026-06-05/NOTES.md` records an isolated integration attempt and explicitly says the
  old keystone did not close against that base.
* `dispositions/*.md` files are campaign-specific dispositions; prefer the issue list above for
  current ownership and open work.
