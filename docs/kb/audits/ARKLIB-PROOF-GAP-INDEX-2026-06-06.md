# ArkLib proof-gap index (2026-06-06)

This index closes the umbrella audit role for ArkLib proof gaps. It records how to reproduce the
census and where each named residual family is tracked. Focused issues own the remaining proof work;
this document prevents the same residual surfaces from being rediscovered as anonymous holes.

## Audit commands

Raw proof holes and project-level assumptions:

```sh
rg -n --glob '*.lean' '^\s*(sorry|admit)\b|:=\s*(by\s+)?(sorry|admit)\b|by\s+(sorry|admit)\b|\baxiom\s+[A-Za-z_]|opaque\s+[A-Za-z_]' ArkLib
```

Current clean-tree census (2026-06-06, `python3 scripts/sorry_census.py`):

```json
{
  "total_tokens": 310,
  "holes": 0,
  "doc_mentions": 310,
  "files_with_holes": 0,
  "decls_with_holes": 0
}
```

Named residual APIs:

```sh
rg -n --glob '*.lean' '^(noncomputable\s+)?(def|structure|class|theorem|lemma)\s+\w*Residual\w*|\b\w*Residual\w*\s*:' ArkLib
```

Placeholders, explicit hypotheses, and roadmap markers:

```sh
rg -n --glob '*.lean' 'opaque\s+\w+|placeholder|stub|TODO|FIXME|named residual|explicit hypothesis|remaining unproven|only remaining|sole residual|single remaining' ArkLib
```

proximity-prize index; see "Related indexes" below.

## Interpretation

The current tree should be read as residualized, not silently complete. A focused issue is the
source of ownership for each residual family. If a proof route is mathematically false or external
to ArkLib's current formal scope, it should be documented as such rather than hidden behind `True`,
`opaque`, or a broad placeholder.
