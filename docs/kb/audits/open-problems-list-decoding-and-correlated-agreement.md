# Paper Audit: Open Problems in List Decoding and Correlated Agreement

Paper-to-ArkLib audit for *Open Problems in List Decoding and Correlated
Agreement* (Arnon, Boneh, Fenzi; April 8, 2026). Lists the paper's named
formal items and records whether each one is currently present in ArkLib,
missing, or present in a materially different form.

This audit is the **status snapshot**. The forward-looking roadmap lives in
[`../../../ABF26_PLAN.md`](../../../ABF26_PLAN.md). Every per-item PR is
expected to update both files in the same commit.

`ABF26.pdf` in the working tree and the file the previous audit referred to
as `paper.pdf` are the same document; the audit always refers to it by its
short name `ABF26`.

## Metadata

- **Paper**: ABF26 — *Open Problems in List Decoding and Correlated Agreement*, April 8, 2026
- **Paper SHA-256** (of `ABF26.pdf` at audit time): `e543ec6a4f3312b4383000e72e5aa23862e79cc9770ce21db2c48db679581de3`
- **Last verified against commit**: `05a010e3` (2026-05-14)
- **Audit owner**: Phase 0 of [`ABF26_PLAN.md`](../../../ABF26_PLAN.md)

## Status Legend

- `present`: close match in ArkLib, no `sorry` blocking it.
- `present-but-different`: underlying concept exists, but the interface,
  statement shape, or abstraction level differs materially from the paper.
- `present-but-incomplete`: the relevant theorem/symbol exists but the cited
  file still contains `sorry`.
- `missing`: no close formalization was found.
- `deferred`: in scope of a later phase per the plan; not currently worked
  on.

## Notes

- Rows follow the theorem-like items extracted from the PDF, plus named
  facts and remarks when they materially affect the comparison.
- The **ABF26 ID** column matches the `ABF26-*` identifiers used throughout
  [`../../../ABF26_PLAN.md`](../../../ABF26_PLAN.md) (e.g. `D2.13`, `T4.13`,
  `L4.6`).
- The **Lean target** column gives the canonical declaration name we will
  use once the plan lands. For `present` rows this is the existing name;
  for other rows it is the proposed name locked in by the plan.
- The **Lean refs** column lists existing declarations and the files
  containing them.
- "External" Lean target rows reference results the paper itself states
  without proof; per the plan they will be admitted with tagged `sorry`s.
  See the conjecture/external-result ledger in `ABF26_PLAN.md` §6.

## Drift since last audit

Three rows the previous audit flagged as `present-but-incomplete` are now
fully sorry-free, thanks to PR #385 (AHIV22, 2026-04-24), PR #463 (BCIKS20
`ReedSolomonGap`, 2026-04-30), and commit `6389c0e` (BCIKS20
`AffineSpaces`, 2026-05-05; pushed directly with no associated PR
number). Those rows are re-tagged `present` below. One file
([`ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/AffineLines/Main.lean`](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/AffineLines/Main.lean))
still has the single `sorry` the previous audit identified at line 40 of
`RS_correlatedAgreement_affineLines`. Several files under
`BCIKS20/ListDecoding/`, `BCIKS20/WeightedAgreement.lean`,
`DG25/MainResults.lean`, and `Whir/MutualCorrAgreement.lean` retain
pre-existing `sorry`s and are surfaced in the **Existing Inconsistencies**
section below. Two supporting files relevant to the Phase 1 ε-error
migration and the still-open non-unique-decoding branch:
[`ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon/FftDomain.lean`](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon/FftDomain.lean)
(smooth-domain FFT infrastructure, added 2026-04-17 in PR #448) and
[`ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/AffineLines/JointAgreement.lean`](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/AffineLines/JointAgreement.lean)
(bivariate-existence lemmas, added 2026-03-11 by `b333f6ba`).

## Section 1 — Grand Challenges (introduction)

Specialisation to the paper's RS parameter regime (ρ ∈ {1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16}, ε* = 2^(-128)) is a call-site instantiation. Resolution is open. |

| `D2.4` | Hamming-ball volume `Vol_q(δ,n)` | present | `CodingTheory.hammingBallVolume` in [HammingBallVolume.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/HammingBallVolume.lean); supporting `hammingBall`/`relHammingBall` sets in [ListDecodability.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ListDecodability.lean) | existing | `noncomputable def` (depends on `Nat.floor` over `ℝ`). Boundary case `Vol_q(0, n) = 1` is a `@[simp]` lemma. |
| `D2.5` | ECC, `δ_min`, rate | present-but-different | `Code.dist`, `Code.minDist` in [Distance.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/Basic/Distance.lean); `LinearCode.rate` in [LinearCode.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/Basic/LinearCode.lean) | existing + `scoped notation "δ_min"`, `scoped notation "ρ"` in `ABF26Notation.lean` (new) | Paper uses `C ⊆ Σ^n`; ArkLib uses function spaces. Mathematically equivalent. |
| `L2.6` | Singleton bound | present | `singleton_bound`, `singleton_bound_linear` in [LinearCode.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/Basic/LinearCode.lean) | existing | No action; consider adding an `IsMDS` predicate equal to `ρ = 1 − δ_min + 1/n`. |
| `D2.7` | F-additive code | present-but-different | `ModuleCode`, `LinearCode` in [LinearCode.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/Basic/LinearCode.lean) | `CodingTheory.IsFAdditive` | Same idea modulo `Σ ≃ₗ[F] (Fin s → F)`; no F-additive predicate yet. |

| `D2.9` | `m`-interleaved code `C^≡m` | present-but-different | `interleavedCodeSet`, `codewordStackSet` in [InterleavedCode.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/InterleavedCode.lean) | existing + `scoped notation "_^≡_"` | Matrix-based API; paper uses tuple notation. |
| `L2.10` | `\|Λ(C^≡m,δ)\| ≤ binom(b+r,r)·\|Λ\|^r` | missing | none | `InterleavedCode.lambda_le` | GGR11 bound. |
| `D2.11` | Reed-Solomon code `RS[F,L,k]` | present-but-different | `ReedSolomon.code` in [ReedSolomon.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon.lean) | existing + `scoped notation "RS[" F ", " L ", " k "]"` | Parameterised by injection `ι ↪ F` rather than `L ⊆ F`. Strictly more general. |
| `D2.12` | Smooth domain | present | `ReedSolomon.Smooth` in [ReedSolomon.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon.lean) | existing | Verified: typeclass requires multiplicative coset of a subgroup with order a power of two. New companion file [FftDomain.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon/FftDomain.lean) provides FFT-domain machinery; not a paper-item match but noted here for completeness. |
| `D2.13` | s-interleaved RS `IRS[F,L,k,s]` | present | [ReedSolomon/Interleaved.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon/Interleaved.lean) | `ReedSolomon.Interleaved.irsCode` | Defined as `interleavedCodeSet (RS[F, L, ⌊k/s⌋])`. |

## Section 6 — Toy Problem (deferred)

All §6 items are tracked as `deferred` pending the OracleReduction security
framework gaps being closed. Plan Phase 8 holds these.

## Existing Inconsistencies

The largest mismatches between the paper and ArkLib are structural rather
than mathematical. These drive Phase 1 of `ABF26_PLAN.md`.

1. **Correlated agreement is formalized as predicates, not error functions.**
   ArkLib currently exposes `δ_ε_correlatedAgreement...` predicates in
   [ProximityGap/Basic.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/Basic.lean),
   while the paper is organized around numeric error functions `ε_pg`,
   `ε_ca`, and `ε_mca`. Closing this is the linchpin of Phase 1.

2. **General MCA is not yet a first-class coding-theory notion.**
   The TODO at the top of
   [ProximityGap/Basic.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/Basic.lean)
   still lists mutual correlated agreement as missing. The
   [Whir/MutualCorrAgreement.lean](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/Whir/MutualCorrAgreement.lean)
   file is WHIR/proximity-generator specific and is not a drop-in
   formalization of Section 4. Phase 1 re-expresses the WHIR notion as a
   specialization of the new general `epsMCA`.

3. **The non-unique-decoding branch of BCIKS20 AffineLines is still open.**
   [BCIKS20/AffineLines/Main.lean:40](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/AffineLines/Main.lean)
   contains a single `sorry` in `RS_correlatedAgreement_affineLines`. The
   newly-added
   [JointAgreement.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/AffineLines/JointAgreement.lean)
   builds the bivariate-existence machinery needed to close it.

4. **Some proximity-gap and MCA files retain `sorry`s.** Specifically:
   [BCIKS20/Curves.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/Curves.lean)
   (3),
   [BCIKS20/ListDecoding/Agreement.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/ListDecoding/Agreement.lean)
   (8),
   [Extraction.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/ListDecoding/Extraction.lean)
   (2),
   [Guruswami.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/ListDecoding/Guruswami.lean)
   (2),
   [WeightedAgreement.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/WeightedAgreement.lean)
   (6),
   [DG25/MainResults.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/DG25/MainResults.lean)
   (2),
   [Whir/MutualCorrAgreement.lean](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/Whir/MutualCorrAgreement.lean)
   (5), and
   [GuruswamiSudan/GuruswamiSudan.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/GuruswamiSudan/GuruswamiSudan.lean)
   (3). The previously-flagged files
   [AHIV22.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/AHIV22.lean),
   [BCIKS20/ReedSolomonGap.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/ReedSolomonGap.lean),
   and
   [BCIKS20/AffineSpaces.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/AffineSpaces.lean)
   are now sorry-free thanks to PRs #385, #463, and commit `6389c0e`
   (the last was pushed directly to `main` with no associated PR number).

5. **Several code families used centrally by the paper are absent.**
   Folded Reed-Solomon (D2.14, D2.15), univariate multiplicity codes (A.7),
   subspace-design codes (D2.16, L2.17, T2.18), and extension-field codes
   (D2.19, D2.20, L2.21) are not yet represented directly in ArkLib.
   Plan Phase 3 adds them.

## Forward roadmap

The previous version of this document contained a six-phase roadmap. That
roadmap has been migrated and substantially expanded in
[`../../../ABF26_PLAN.md`](../../../ABF26_PLAN.md), which now contains:

- a nine-phase ordering with prerequisites,
- per-PR scopes,
- a per-item ledger with sub-tasks, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and
  open questions, and
- a conjecture/external-result ledger covering the 18 items the paper
  itself states without full proof.

Future updates to status, scope, or sequencing belong in `ABF26_PLAN.md`.
This audit doc is updated row-by-row as PRs land.
