# Paper Audit: Open Problems in List Decoding and Correlated Agreement

Paper-to-ArkLib audit for *Open Problems in List Decoding and Correlated
Agreement* (Arnon, Boneh, Fenzi; April 8, 2026). Lists the paper's named
formal items and records whether each one is currently present in ArkLib,
missing, or present in a materially different form.

This audit is the **status snapshot**. Forward-looking work lives in two
places:

- High-level end-goal levels + phased roadmap:
  [`../queries/abf26-pr-roadmap.md`](../queries/abf26-pr-roadmap.md).
- Per-item implementation scaffolding:
  [`../ABF26_PLAN.md`](../ABF26_PLAN.md) (large; the
  authoritative per-item plan).

Backward-looking review findings + per-finding resolution log:
[`../queries/abf26-review-2026-05.md`](../queries/abf26-review-2026-05.md).

Every per-item PR is expected to update this audit row in the same
commit.

`ABF26.pdf` in the working tree and the file the previous audit referred to
as `paper.pdf` are the same document; the audit always refers to it by its
short name `ABF26`.

## Metadata

- **Paper**: ABF26 — *Open Problems in List Decoding and Correlated Agreement*, April 8, 2026
- **Paper SHA-256** (of `ABF26.pdf` at audit time): `e543ec6a4f3312b4383000e72e5aa23862e79cc9770ce21db2c48db679581de3`
- **Last verified against commit**: `05a010e3` (2026-05-14)
- **Audit owner**: Phase 0 of [`ABF26_PLAN.md`](../ABF26_PLAN.md)

## Status Legend

- `present`: close match in ArkLib, no `sorry` blocking it.
- `present-but-different`: underlying concept exists, but the interface,
  statement shape, or abstraction level differs materially from the paper.
- `present-but-incomplete`: the relevant theorem/symbol exists but the cited
  file still contains `sorry`.
- `missing`: no close formalization was found.
- `deferred`: in scope of a later phase per the plan; not currently worked
  on.

## Notes

- Rows follow the theorem-like items extracted from the PDF, plus named
  facts and remarks when they materially affect the comparison.
- The **ABF26 ID** column matches the `ABF26-*` identifiers used throughout
  [`../ABF26_PLAN.md`](../ABF26_PLAN.md) (e.g. `D2.13`, `T4.13`,
  `L4.6`).
- The **Lean target** column gives the canonical declaration name we will
  use once the plan lands. For `present` rows this is the existing name;
  for other rows it is the proposed name locked in by the plan.
- The **Lean refs** column lists existing declarations and the files
  containing them.
- "External" Lean target rows reference results the paper itself states
  without proof; per the plan they will be admitted with tagged `sorry`s.
  See the conjecture/external-result ledger in `ABF26_PLAN.md` §6.

## Drift since last audit

Three rows the previous audit flagged as `present-but-incomplete` are now
fully sorry-free, thanks to PR #385 (AHIV22, 2026-04-24), PR #463 (BCIKS20
`ReedSolomonGap`, 2026-04-30), and commit `6389c0e` (BCIKS20
`AffineSpaces`, 2026-05-05; pushed directly with no associated PR
number). Those rows are re-tagged `present` below. One file
([`ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/AffineLines/Main.lean`](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/AffineLines/Main.lean))
still has the single `sorry` the previous audit identified at line 40 of
`RS_correlatedAgreement_affineLines`. Several files under
`BCIKS20/ListDecoding/`, `BCIKS20/WeightedAgreement.lean`,
`DG25/MainResults.lean`, and `Whir/MutualCorrAgreement.lean` retain
pre-existing `sorry`s and are surfaced in the **Existing Inconsistencies**
section below. Two supporting files relevant to the Phase 1 ε-error
migration and the still-open non-unique-decoding branch:
[`ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon/FftDomain.lean`](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon/FftDomain.lean)
(smooth-domain FFT infrastructure, added 2026-04-17 in PR #448) and
[`ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/AffineLines/JointAgreement.lean`](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/AffineLines/JointAgreement.lean)
(bivariate-existence lemmas, added 2026-03-11 by `b333f6ba`).

**This-PR additions** (`feat/abf26-plan` branch): three in-tree sorries
discharged in proof-discharge passes after the statement layer landed:
`dim_irsCode` (D2.13 dim formula, commit `3b0cfc99`),
`hammingBallVolume_eq_ncard_hammingBall` and its sub-sorries
`card_filter_hammingDist_eq` (`c01232f3`) and the Set/Finset card conversion
(`13f02444`) for D2.4, and `minDist_div_card_eq_minRelHammingDistCode`
(`3f344a00`, via a `Set.Finite.toFinset` refactor of `minRelHammingDistCode`
to dodge a `Fintype.ofFinite` instance diamond). Several new bridge lemmas
land in `Basic/LinearCode.lean` (`IsMDS_iff_singleton_bound_tight`),
`Basic/RelativeDistance.lean` (the `minDist_div_card` bridge above plus
characterisation lemmas for `minRelHammingDistCode`), and
`Whir/MutualCorrAgreement.lean` (`proximityCondition_imp_mcaEvent_affineLine`
and the probability-level `Pr_proximityCondition_le_epsMCA`, one-way bridges
documenting the WHIR↔ABF26 MCA asymmetry recorded in commit `d01117c8`).

## Section 1 — Grand Challenges (introduction)

| ABF26 ID | Paper item | Status | Lean refs | Lean target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GC1` | Grand MCA Challenge (page 5): "determine the largest `δ*_C ∈ [0, 1]` such that `ε_mca(C, δ*_C) ≤ ε*`" | present (as predicate) | `ProximityGap.grandMCAChallenge` in [GrandChallenges.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/GrandChallenges.lean) | existing | Stated as a generic `Prop`-valued predicate over a `LinearCode ι F` and a threshold `ε* : ℝ≥0`. Specialisation to the paper's RS parameter regime (ρ ∈ {1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16}, ε* = 2^(-128)) is a call-site instantiation. Resolution is open. |
| `GC2` | Grand List Decoding Challenge (page 5): "determine the largest `δ*_C ∈ [0, 1]` such that `\|Λ(C^≡m, δ*_C)\| ≤ ε* · \|F\|`" | present (as predicate) | `ProximityGap.grandListDecodingChallenge` in [GrandChallenges.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/GrandChallenges.lean) | existing | Stated as a generic `Prop`-valued predicate. Uses `ListDecodable.Lambda` for `\|Λ(C^≡m, ·)\|` (ABF26 D2.8). Resolution is open. |

## Section 2 — Preliminaries

| ABF26 ID | Paper item | Status | Lean refs | Lean target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `L2.1` | Polynomial identity lemma | present | `prob_polynomial_identity_le`, `prob_schwartz_zippel_mv_polynomial_of_totalDegree_le`, `MvPolynomial.totalDegree_le_of_degreeOf_lt` in [Instances.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/Probability/Instances.lean); `schwartz_zippel_of_fintype` in [Interpolation.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/MvPolynomial/Interpolation.lean) | `prob_polynomial_identity_le` | Paper bound `m·(d-1)/|F|` for individual-degree-`<d` polynomials, realised as `prob_polynomial_identity_le`. Derived from the generalised Schwartz-Zippel wrapper `prob_schwartz_zippel_mv_polynomial_of_totalDegree_le` (which takes any `d ≥ totalDegree P`) via the `MvPolynomial.totalDegree_le_of_degreeOf_lt` helper. The legacy specialisation `prob_schwartz_zippel_mv_polynomial` (bound `≤ n / \|F\|` when `totalDegree ≤ n`) is preserved as a one-line wrapper. |
| `D2.2` | q-entropy function `H_q` | present | `CodingTheory.qEntropy` in [Entropy.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/Basic/Entropy.lean) | existing | `noncomputable def`; uses Mathlib's `Real.logb`. Boundary case `qEntropy q 0 = 0` is a `@[simp]` lemma. |
| `D2.3` | Restricted Hamming distance `Δ_T` | present | `CodingTheory.restrictedRelHammingDist` in [RelativeDistance.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/Basic/RelativeDistance.lean); existing full-domain `Δ₀`/`δᵣ` in [Distance.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/Basic/Distance.lean) and [RelativeDistance.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/Basic/RelativeDistance.lean) | existing | `ℝ≥0`-valued; `T = ∅` gives `0` via `NNReal`'s `0/0 = 0`. |
| `D2.4` | Hamming-ball volume `Vol_q(δ,n)` | present | `CodingTheory.hammingBallVolume` in [HammingBallVolume.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/HammingBallVolume.lean); supporting `hammingBall`/`relHammingBall` sets in [ListDecodability.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ListDecodability.lean) | existing | `noncomputable def` (depends on `Nat.floor` over `ℝ`). Boundary case `Vol_q(0, n) = 1` is a `@[simp]` lemma. |
| `D2.5` | ECC, `δ_min`, rate | present-but-different | `Code.dist`, `Code.minDist` in [Distance.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/Basic/Distance.lean); `LinearCode.rate` in [LinearCode.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/Basic/LinearCode.lean); bridge `minDist_div_card_eq_minRelHammingDistCode` and supporting `minRelHammingDistCode` in [RelativeDistance.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/Basic/RelativeDistance.lean) linking the raw `Code.minDist C / n` form to `δᵣ C` (proved, via `Set.Finite.toFinset` refactor of `minRelHammingDistCode`) | existing | Paper uses `C ⊆ Σ^n`; ArkLib uses function spaces. Mathematically equivalent. Paper-style `δ_min` / `ρ` scoped-notation file was once planned but never materialised — call sites use `Code.minDist C / Fintype.card ι` and `LinearCode.rate` directly. |
| `L2.6` | Singleton bound | present | `singleton_bound`, `singleton_bound_linear`, `IsMDS` predicate (from PR #430), and `IsMDS_iff_rate_distance` bridge in [LinearCode.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/Basic/LinearCode.lean) | existing | `IsMDS LC` encodes the additive Nat Singleton-tight condition `Code.dist LC.carrier = length LC - dim LC + 1`; the bridge `IsMDS_iff_rate_distance` connects it to the rate-distance form `δ_min(LC)/n = 1 - dim/n + 1/n` used by ABF26 §2-§3. |
| `D2.7` | F-additive code | present-but-different | `ModuleCode`, `LinearCode` in [LinearCode.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/Basic/LinearCode.lean) | use `ModuleCode ι F (Fin s → F)` directly | `ModuleCode` / `LinearCode` *bake in* F-linear subspace structure — the paper's "F-additive" notion is realised by these existing types. Theorems quantifying over a paper-style "F-additive `Set`-coded code `C`" can write `∃ MC : Submodule F (ι → A), (MC : Set _) = C` inline rather than via a dedicated paper-shape predicate; ArkLib convention avoids alias-style wrappers for items already realised by existing types. |
| `D2.8` | `Λ(C,δ,f)` and `\|Λ(C,δ)\|` | present | `ListDecodable.closeCodewordsRel` (= point list `Λ(C,δ,f)`), `ListDecodable.Lambda`, `closeCodewordsRel_subset_of_le`, `Lambda_mono`, `Lambda_le_ncard` in [ListDecodability.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ListDecodability.lean) | existing | The point list `Λ(C,δ,f)` is the pre-existing `closeCodewordsRel C f δ` (no paper-shape alias: the `Lambda_at` abbrev was removed 2026-05-31). `Lambda` is the new `ℕ∞`-valued maximised list size `\|Λ(C,δ)\|`. |
| `D2.9` | `m`-interleaved code `C^≡m` | present-but-different | `interleavedCodeSet`, `codewordStackSet` in [InterleavedCode.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/InterleavedCode.lean) | existing + `scoped notation "_^≡_"` | Matrix-based API; paper uses tuple notation. |
| `L2.10` | `\|Λ(C^≡m,δ)\| ≤ binom(b+r,r)·\|Λ\|^r` | present-but-incomplete | `InterleavedCode.lambda_le_ggr11` in [InterleavedCode.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/InterleavedCode.lean) | same | External admit `[GGR11]`. Statement binds `η := δ_C − δ`, `b := ⌈δ/η⌉`, `r := ⌈log₂(δ_C/η)⌉` and shows `|Λ(C^{≡m}, δ)| ≤ (b+r choose r) · |Λ(C, δ)|^r` for all `m ≥ 1`. |
| `D2.11` | Reed-Solomon code `RS[F,L,k]` | present-but-different | `ReedSolomon.code` in [ReedSolomon.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon.lean) | existing + `scoped notation "RS[" F ", " L ", " k "]"` | Parameterised by injection `ι ↪ F` rather than `L ⊆ F`. Strictly more general. |
| `D2.12` | Smooth domain | present | `ReedSolomon.Smooth` in [ReedSolomon.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon.lean) | existing | Verified: typeclass requires multiplicative coset of a subgroup with order a power of two. New companion file [FftDomain.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon/FftDomain.lean) provides FFT-domain machinery; not a paper-item match but noted here for completeness. |
| `D2.13` | s-interleaved RS `IRS[F,L,k,s]` | present | [ReedSolomon/Interleaved.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon/Interleaved.lean) | `ReedSolomon.Interleaved.irsCode`, plus `dim_irsCode` (proved) | Defined as `interleavedCodeSet (RS[F, L, ⌊k/s⌋])`. Dimension formula `dim(IRS) = s · (k/s)` proved via injective F-linear `(Fin s → ↥RS) → (ι → Fin s → F)` + `finrank_pi_fintype`. |
| `D2.14` | `(L,s)`-admissible field element | present | [ReedSolomon/Folded.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon/Folded.lean) | `ReedSolomon.Folded.Admissible` | Required by D2.15. |
| `D2.15` | Folded RS `FRS[F,L,k,s,ω]` | present | [ReedSolomon/Folded.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon/Folded.lean) | `ReedSolomon.Folded.frsCode` | Used pervasively in §3, §4, §6.3.2. |
| `D2.16` | τ-subspace-design code | present | [SubspaceDesign.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/SubspaceDesign.lean) | `CodingTheory.IsSubspaceDesign` | GX13 definition; uses `LinearMap.proj` for `A_i`. |
| `L2.17` | `min τ(r) ≥ ρ − 1/n` | stated (external admit) | [SubspaceDesign.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/SubspaceDesign.lean) | `CodingTheory.subspaceDesign_tau_lower` | GG25 lemma; tagged sorry. |
| `T2.18` | FRS and UM are subspace-design | stated (external admit; FRS half only) | [SubspaceDesign.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/SubspaceDesign.lean) | `CodingTheory.frs_is_subspaceDesign_gk16` | GK16 theorem; tagged sorry. UM half deferred pending D2.19. |
| `D2.19` | Extension field presentation `(B,F,e,ψ,φ)` | present | [ExtensionCodes.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ExtensionCodes.lean) | `CodingTheory.ExtensionFieldPresentation` (structure wrapping `[Algebra B F]` + `Basis (Fin e) B F`), plus `IsSystematic` for the systematic variant. | Refactored to wrap Mathlib's `Algebra B F` + `Basis (Fin e) B F` directly (no parallel implementation of the field embedding / coordinate iso). `ψ := algebraMap B F`, `φ := basis.equivFun`, `coord j := proj j ∘ φ`. Univariate-multiplicity code (paper's namesake `DA.7`) is a *different* item, despite sharing a number. |
| `D2.20` | Extension code `C_F` | present | [ExtensionCodes.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ExtensionCodes.lean) | `CodingTheory.extensionCode` (Set form) + `CodingTheory.extensionCodeSubmodule` (Submodule form, mirroring `ReedSolomon.code`'s shape in [ReedSolomon.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon.lean)) | Set-level definition; uses coordinate-projections `P.coord j` of D2.19. **All closure laws proven**: `extensionCode_add_mem` (addition), `extensionCode_psi_smul_mem` (B-side scalar via `ψ`), and `extensionCode_smul_mem` (F-scalar closure, paper's D2.20 F-linearity claim, closed via basis-expansion through `Basis.sum_equivFun` + `Finset.sum_induction`). The Submodule packaging `extensionCodeSubmodule` bundles all three into a `Submodule F (ι → F)` (consumed by downstream code that wants a linear-code type; `coe_extensionCodeSubmodule` is the carrier bridge). Distance equality `δ_min(C_F) = δ_min(C_B)` from DP25 not formalised — separate paper item. |
| `L2.21` | `\|Λ(C_F,δ)\| = \|Λ(C_B^e,δ)\|` | stated (external admit) | [ExtensionCodes.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ExtensionCodes.lean) | `CodingTheory.lambda_extensionCode_eq_lambda_interleaved` | BCFW25 Lemma D.3; tagged sorry. |

| `T3.6` | Random RS near capacity | deferred | none | `ABF26.random_rs_list_decoding` (external) | AGL24 Thm 1.1. **Blocker (shared with T4.15): the statement bounds `Pr_{L ←$ (F choose n)}[…]`, requiring a uniform-subset distribution over `F`. ArkLib's `Data/Probability/` doesn't yet have this primitive; without it the type signature can't even be written. Once that infrastructure lands, the bound itself is a paper-cited external admit.** |

## Section 4 — Correlated Agreement Conjectures

The WHIR `hasMutualCorrAgreement` re-expression as a specialization of `epsMCA` is a follow-up commit. |
| `R4.4` | MCA with proximity loss intentionally undefined | present | file docstring in [ProximityGap/Errors.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/Errors.lean) | docstring | Documentation only; documented in the "Note on MCA with proximity loss" subsection of the file docstring. |
| `F4.5` | `ε_pg ≤ ε_ca ≤ ε_mca` | present | `ProximityGap.epsPG`, `ProximityGap.epsPG_le_epsCA`, `ProximityGap.epsCA_le_epsMCA`, `ProximityGap.epsPG_le_epsCA_le_epsMCA`, plus helper `ProximityGap.jointProximity_imp_line_close` in [ProximityGap/Errors.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/Errors.lean) | existing | Closed in stages; proved for `Submodule F (ι → A)`. |

Proof is non-trivial — not the obvious `δ < δ_min/2` uniqueness, but a dominance argument over `u`. Tracked in `ABF26_PLAN.md` §6 conjecture ledger. |
| `L4.7` | `ε_mca(C^≡t,δ) ≤ t·ε_mca(C,δ)` | present | `ProximityGap.epsMCA_interleaved_le` plus local helper `ProximityGap.Pr_exists_Fin_le_sum` (union-bound for finitely-indexed existentials) in [ProximityGap/Errors.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/Errors.lean) | existing | Proved via row-decomposition of the interleaved `mcaEvent` plus the `Pr_exists_Fin_le_sum` union bound. |

## Section 5 — Connections Between List Decoding and Correlated Agreement

## Section 6 — Toy Problem (deferred)

All §6 items are tracked as `deferred` pending the OracleReduction security
framework gaps being closed. Plan Phase 8 holds these.

| ABF26 ID | Paper item | Status | Lean refs | Lean target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `D6.1` | Toy problem relation `R_C^ℓ` | present | `ToyProblem.relation` in [Definitions.lean](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/ToyProblem/Definitions.lean) | `ToyProblem.relation` | Existence-of-message-matrix form; works for any `Set`-shaped code. |
| `C6.2` | Construction 6.2 | present | `ToyProblem.Spec.pSpec`, `Statement`, `OracleStatement`, `Witness`, `accepts`, `inputRelation`, `outputRelation`, `prover`, `verifier`, `reduction`, `oracleProver`, `oracleVerifier`, `oracleReduction`, `queryG`, `queryF`, `accepts_of_inputRelation` in [Spec/General.lean](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/ToyProblem/Spec/General.lean) | same | Three-round `ProtocolSpec` (γ / g / spot-checks) with `OracleInterface` / `SampleableType` instances. Full honest `Prover` / `Verifier` / `Reduction` triple (computable, non-oracle) **and** `OracleProver` / `OracleVerifier` / `OracleReduction` flavour with real query-based verify body (`queryG`, `queryF` mirroring FRI's `getConst`/`queryCodeword`; query complexity `2t+1`). Honest-completeness point form `accepts_of_inputRelation` **proven** (ring + linearity). The protocol-level `oracleReduction_perfectCompleteness` stub lives in the same file (depends on `accepts_of_inputRelation` plus `OracleReduction.toReduction` plumbing — tagged sorry, tracked under the roadmap query's Phase 2, not in the audit table since it is a Lean-side strengthening rather than a separate paper item). IRS instantiation in `Impl/IRS.lean`. (Note: the previous 1-arity relaxed relation `outputRelation₁` was relocated to `SimplifiedIOR.outputRelation` in `Spec/SimplifiedIOR.lean` so its type matches the C6.9 split output statement / oracle / witness.) |
| `D6.3` | Relaxed toy relation `R̃_C,δ^ℓ` | present | `ToyProblem.relaxedRelation` in [Definitions.lean](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/ToyProblem/Definitions.lean) | `ToyProblem.relaxedRelation` | Existence of a valid instance `W*` with at least `(1−δ)·\|ι\|` columns agreeing on every row. |
| `D6.4` | Erasure correction | present | `CodingTheory.SupportsErasureCorrection` in [Erasure.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/Erasure.lean); re-exported as `ToyProblem.SupportsErasureCorrection` from [Definitions.lean](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/ToyProblem/Definitions.lean) | `CodingTheory.SupportsErasureCorrection` | Predicate is generic (lives under `CodingTheory/`); a `@[reducible]` re-export keeps `ToyProblem.SupportsErasureCorrection` resolving. Both clauses of the paper's definition are encoded — (i) recovery when erasures `< δ_min·n` ∧ matching codeword, (ii) `E f = none` otherwise. Correction-time `ecor` is a `ℕ` parameter (not yet enforced operationally). |
| `L6.5` | Every additive code supports erasure correction | present-but-incomplete | `ToyProblem.additive_code_supports_erasure_correction_grs25` in [SoundnessBounds.lean](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/ToyProblem/SoundnessBounds.lean) | same | `external admit [GRS25]` (genuinely imported). Existence form (some `ecor` works); the paper's `O((s·n)³)` correction-time bound is **deliberately dropped** (pinning the constant needs a concrete encoder model). Faithful weakening, flagged here. |
| `L6.6` | Knowledge soundness of Construction 6.2 | present-but-incomplete | `ToyProblem.Spec.protocol62_knowledgeSound` in [Spec/General.lean](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/ToyProblem/Spec/General.lean) | same | Stated against `Verifier.knowledgeSoundness` with `relIn := outputRelation k C δ` (the relaxed relation `R̃²_{C,δ}`) and `relOut := Set.univ`. Knowledge error is the **concrete** paper formula `max (ε_mca(C,δ) + \|Λ(C^{≡2},δ)\| / \|F\|) ((1−δ)^t)` (de-vacuified 2026-05-31: was an empty `∃ knowledgeError` before). Carries the paper's load-bearing `δ < δ_min(C)` hypothesis (`δ < (minRelHammingDistCode C : ℝ≥0)`, added 2026-06-02) + `[Nonempty ι]`. **`paper-proof-owed`** (ABF26's OWN §6.2 result, not an external import — re-tagged 2026-06-02); sorry on the proof only. |
| `R6.7` | CA insufficient for L6.6 proof | present | `ToyProblem.Spec.remark67` (narrative; sits in L6.6 docstring) in [Spec/General.lean](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/ToyProblem/Spec/General.lean) | same | Encoded as a docstring + a `Unit`-valued marker definition. |
| `L6.8` | Round-by-round knowledge soundness of Construction 6.2 | present-but-incomplete | `ToyProblem.Spec.protocol62_rbrKnowledgeSound` in [Spec/General.lean](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/ToyProblem/Spec/General.lean) | same | Stated against `Verifier.rbrKnowledgeSoundness` (paper Def A.5 ≡ ArkLib's `KnowledgeStateFunction`) with `relIn := outputRelation k C δ`, `relOut := Set.univ`. Per-challenge error is the **concrete** function (round 0 ↦ `ε_mca + \|Λ(C^{≡2},δ)\|/\|F\|`, round 2 ↦ `(1−δ)^t`); de-vacuified 2026-05-31. Carries `δ < δ_min(C)` + `[Nonempty ι]` (2026-06-02). **`paper-proof-owed`** (ABF26's OWN §6.2 result; re-tagged 2026-06-02); sorry on the proof only. |
| `C6.9` | Construction 6.9 (attack target) | present | `ToyProblem.SimplifiedIOR.pSpec`, `OutputStatement`, `OutputOracleStatement`, `OutputWitness`, `outputRelation`, `prover`, `verifier`, `reduction` in [Spec/SimplifiedIOR.lean](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/ToyProblem/Spec/SimplifiedIOR.lean) | same | One-round V→P γ reducing IOR, mapping `(v, μ₁, μ₂, f₁, f₂) ↦ (v, μ₁+γ·μ₂, f₁+γ·f₂)`. Sibling file to `Spec/General.lean` (C6.2). **Only the non-oracle flavour is shipped**: an `OracleReduction` version would require declaring the combined output oracle `f_new := f₁ + γ·f₂` as an arbitrary function of `(f₁, f₂, γ)`, but the current `OracleVerifier.embed` machinery in [`OracleReduction/Basic.lean`](../../../ArkLib/OracleReduction/Basic.lean) only allows the output oracle family to be a *verbatim subset* of input oracles + prover messages. A `simOStmt`-based refactor of the framework (sketched in `Basic.lean:278, 293`) is needed before the oracle flavour can be added. The bundled-input non-oracle `reduction` captures full semantics in the meantime. |
| `L6.10` | Soundness of Construction 6.9 | present-but-incomplete | `ToyProblem.SimplifiedIOR.simplifiedIOR_knowledgeSound` in [Spec/SimplifiedIOR.lean](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/ToyProblem/Spec/SimplifiedIOR.lean) | same | Stated against `Verifier.knowledgeSoundness` with `relIn := ToyProblem.Spec.outputRelation` (= `R̃²_{C,δ}`) and `relOut := ToyProblem.SimplifiedIOR.outputRelation` (= `R̃¹_{C,δ}`). Knowledge error is the **concrete** `ε_mca(C,δ) + \|Λ(C^{≡2},δ)\|/\|F\|` (no `(1−δ)^t` term; de-vacuified 2026-05-31). Carries `δ < δ_min(C)` + `[Nonempty ι]` (2026-06-02). **`paper-proof-owed`** (ABF26's OWN §6.4 result, the 1-round form of L6.8; re-tagged 2026-06-02); sorry on the proof only. |
| `D6.11` | Winning set `Ω` | present | `ToyProblem.winningSet` in [Definitions.lean](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/ToyProblem/Definitions.lean) | `ToyProblem.winningSet` | `Set F` of challenges; cardinality bounds drive L6.12 / L6.13. |
| `L6.12` | List-decoding lower-bound attack | present-but-incomplete | `ToyProblem.simplified_iop_soundness_listDecoding_lb` in [SoundnessBounds.lean](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/ToyProblem/SoundnessBounds.lean) | same | **`paper-proof-owed`** (ABF26's OWN §6.4.1 result; re-tagged 2026-06-02) — **in-tree provable now**: its key lemma Claim B.1 (`Probability.exists_large_image_of_pairwise_collision_bound`) is already closed. Sorry on the proof only. |
| `L6.13` | CA lower-bound attack | present-but-incomplete | `ToyProblem.simplified_iop_soundness_ca_lb` in [SoundnessBounds.lean](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/ToyProblem/SoundnessBounds.lean) | same | **`paper-proof-owed`** (ABF26's OWN §6.4.2 result; re-tagged 2026-06-02) — **in-tree provable now** (short elementary proof, no external dependency). The bound is in terms of `ε_ca`, not `ε_mca` (cf. R6.14). Sorry on the proof only. |
| `R6.14` | Attack reaches `ε_ca` not `ε_mca` | deferred | docstring on `simplified_iop_soundness_ca_lb` | docstring | Already noted in L6.13's docstring. |

## Appendix A — Additional Preliminaries

| ABF26 ID | Paper item | Status | Lean refs | Lean target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `A.1` | IOR completeness | present-but-different | `Reduction.completeness`, `Reduction.perfectCompleteness` in [Security/Basic.lean](../../../ArkLib/OracleReduction/Security/Basic.lean) | use `Reduction.perfectCompleteness` directly | Paper's A.1 is realised by the existing definition (which is more general — richer execution / log model). ArkLib convention: use the in-tree name; the paper↔Lean name map lives in this Notes column rather than in an `alias` wrapper. |
| `A.2` | IOP as IOR to trivial relation | present-but-different | same framework in [Security/Basic.lean](../../../ArkLib/OracleReduction/Security/Basic.lean) | docstring on `Reduction.completeness` | Conceptually supported. |
| `A.3` | IOR knowledge soundness | present-but-different | `Verifier.knowledgeSoundness` in [Security/Basic.lean](../../../ArkLib/OracleReduction/Security/Basic.lean) | use `Verifier.knowledgeSoundness` directly | ArkLib's richer execution/log model captures the paper's narrative `(E, et, κ)` extractor presentation. No paper-shape wrapper — use the in-tree name. |
| `A.4` | Knowledge state function | present | [Security/RoundByRound.lean](../../../ArkLib/OracleReduction/Security/RoundByRound.lean) | existing | Aligned with paper. |
| `A.5` | Round-by-round knowledge soundness | present-but-different | `Verifier.rbrKnowledgeSoundnessOneShot`, `Verifier.rbrKnowledgeSoundness` in [Security/RoundByRound.lean](../../../ArkLib/OracleReduction/Security/RoundByRound.lean) | use `Verifier.rbrKnowledgeSoundness` directly | The paper's `KnowledgeStateFunction` machinery and per-round error tuple `(ε_1, …, ε_k)` map directly to the in-tree definition. No paper-shape wrapper. |
| `A.6` | Formal derivative `f^(s)` | present-but-different | Mathlib `Polynomial.derivative` | use `Polynomial.derivative` directly | Iterated `f^(s)` form is `Polynomial.derivative^[s]` (used in `ReedSolomon/Multiplicity.lean`). No paper-shape wrapper — use Mathlib's name. |
| `A.7` | Univariate multiplicity code `UM[F,L,k,s]` | present | `ReedSolomon.Multiplicity.umEvalOnPoints`, `ReedSolomon.Multiplicity.umCode`, `ReedSolomon.Multiplicity.mem_umCode_one_iff_mem_rsCode` in [ReedSolomon/Multiplicity.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon/Multiplicity.lean) | same | Submodule form `(Polynomial.degreeLT F k).map (umEvalOnPoints domain s)`, mirroring `ReedSolomon.code` and `ReedSolomon.Folded.frsCode`. Encoder packages `s` formal-derivative evaluations per domain point. `mem_umCode_one_iff_mem_rsCode` provides the `s = 1` collapse to plain RS (hoisted out of the `[CommRing F]` namespace to a `[Field F]` scope so the `Polynomial F` instance paths align with `ReedSolomon.code`'s). Paper requirement `char(F) ≥ k` is documented but not baked into the bare definition. |

## Appendix B

| ABF26 ID | Paper item | Status | Lean refs | Lean target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `B.1` | Collision bound for random functions | present | `Probability.exists_large_image_of_pairwise_collision_bound` in [Combinatorial.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/Probability/Combinatorial.lean) | `Probability.exists_large_image_of_pairwise_collision_bound` | Closed 2026-05-20. Proof route: helper lemmas `sum_fiber_sq_eq` (fiber-partition + diagonal decomposition) and `cauchy_schwarz_fiber` (`sq_sum_le_card_mul_sum_sq` over `ℝ` via cast); main theorem by contradiction (avoids Jensen): `PMF.bind`-unfolded linearity gives `E[numColls] ≤ N(N-1)ε`, while per-`φ ∈ supp` Cauchy-Schwarz + ENNReal cross-multiplication gives `numColls φ > N(N-1)ε`; `ENNReal.tsum_lt_tsum` strict-averaging closes the loop. |

## Existing Inconsistencies

The largest mismatches between the paper and ArkLib are structural rather
than mathematical. These drive Phase 1 of `ABF26_PLAN.md`.

1. **Correlated agreement is formalized as predicates, not error functions.**
   ArkLib currently exposes `δ_ε_correlatedAgreement...` predicates in
   [ProximityGap/Basic.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/Basic.lean),
   while the paper is organized around numeric error functions `ε_pg`,
   `ε_ca`, and `ε_mca`. Closing this is the linchpin of Phase 1.

2. **General MCA is not yet a first-class coding-theory notion.**
   The TODO at the top of
   [ProximityGap/Basic.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/Basic.lean)
   still lists mutual correlated agreement as missing. The
   [Whir/MutualCorrAgreement.lean](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/Whir/MutualCorrAgreement.lean)
   file is WHIR/proximity-generator specific and is not a drop-in
   formalization of Section 4. Phase 1 re-expresses the WHIR notion as a
   specialization of the new general `epsMCA`.

3. **The non-unique-decoding branch of BCIKS20 AffineLines is still open.**
   [BCIKS20/AffineLines/Main.lean:40](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/AffineLines/Main.lean)
   contains a single `sorry` in `RS_correlatedAgreement_affineLines`. The
   newly-added
   [JointAgreement.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/AffineLines/JointAgreement.lean)
   builds the bivariate-existence machinery needed to close it.

4. **Some proximity-gap and MCA files retain `sorry`s.** Specifically:
   [BCIKS20/Curves.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/Curves.lean)
   (3),
   [BCIKS20/ListDecoding/Agreement.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/ListDecoding/Agreement.lean)
   (8),
   [Extraction.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/ListDecoding/Extraction.lean)
   (2),
   [Guruswami.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/ListDecoding/Guruswami.lean)
   (2),
   [WeightedAgreement.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/WeightedAgreement.lean)
   (6),
   [DG25/MainResults.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/DG25/MainResults.lean)
   (2),
   [Whir/MutualCorrAgreement.lean](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/Whir/MutualCorrAgreement.lean)
   (5), and
   [GuruswamiSudan/GuruswamiSudan.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/GuruswamiSudan/GuruswamiSudan.lean)
   (3). The previously-flagged files
   [AHIV22.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/AHIV22.lean),
   [BCIKS20/ReedSolomonGap.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/ReedSolomonGap.lean),
   and
   [BCIKS20/AffineSpaces.lean](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/AffineSpaces.lean)
   are now sorry-free thanks to PRs #385, #463, and commit `6389c0e`
   (the last was pushed directly to `main` with no associated PR number).

5. ~~**Several code families used centrally by the paper are absent.**~~
   *(Resolved 2026-05.)* All four families are now present in-tree, each
   reachable from a `present` or `present-but-incomplete` row above:
   Folded Reed-Solomon (D2.14, D2.15) in
   [`ReedSolomon/Folded.lean`](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon/Folded.lean);
   univariate multiplicity codes (A.7) in
   [`ReedSolomon/Multiplicity.lean`](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon/Multiplicity.lean);
   subspace-design codes (D2.16, L2.17, T2.18) in
   [`SubspaceDesign.lean`](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/SubspaceDesign.lean);
   and extension-field codes (D2.19, D2.20, L2.21) in
   [`ExtensionCodes.lean`](../../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ExtensionCodes.lean).

## Forward roadmap

The previous version of this document contained a six-phase roadmap. That
roadmap has been migrated and substantially expanded in
[`../ABF26_PLAN.md`](../ABF26_PLAN.md), which now contains:

- a nine-phase ordering with prerequisites,
- per-PR scopes,
- a per-item ledger with sub-tasks, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and
  open questions, and
- a conjecture/external-result ledger covering the 18 items the paper
  itself states without full proof.

Future updates to status, scope, or sequencing belong in `ABF26_PLAN.md`.
This audit doc is updated row-by-row as PRs land.
