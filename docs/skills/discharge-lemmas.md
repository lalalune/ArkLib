# /discharge-lemmas

Use this workflow when the task is to clear out `sorry` placeholders or open proof obligations in
one or more `.lean` files. It triages each gap, places it well in the repo, states it as a clean
lemma, proves the tractable ones, and reports what remains.

This is a general skill, not a subsystem guide. It assumes the work happens in ArkLib's Lean 4
codebase and that `./scripts/validate.sh` is the routine build check.

## Goal

Turn a pile of `sorry`s and proof obligations into:

- a rated, triaged inventory,
- well-placed, cleanly stated lemmas,
- discharged proofs for everything rated below 6,
- and a clear summary of what is proved, what is deferred, and why.

Favor composable proofs that reuse existing Mathlib and ArkLib lemmas over new definitions.

## TODO List

Work through these in order. Do not skip the triage steps just because a `sorry` looks easy —
the rating and placement decisions are what keep the result maintainable.

### 1. Inventory and rate each gap

- Collect every `sorry` and open obligation in scope. Search with
  `grep -rn "sorry" path/to/scope` and cross-check against the build (`lake env lean File.lean`
  surfaces `declaration uses 'sorry'` warnings and any unsolved goals).
- For each gap, read enough surrounding context to understand the actual goal state, not just the
  textual statement. Note the hypotheses in scope and the target type.
- Rate each gap on a 1–10 effort scale:

  | Rating | Meaning | Typical signs |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1–2 | 1–2 minutes | direct `simp`/`rw`/`exact`, a known Mathlib lemma applies almost verbatim |
  | 3–5 | up to ~an hour | a few rewrites, a small induction, locating the right Mathlib API |
  | 6–7 | half a day | nontrivial induction, new auxiliary lemmas, fiddly algebra/analysis |
  | 8–10 | a day or longer | deep theory, missing upstream API, design work, or unclear math |

- Record the rating and a one-line justification per gap. This table is the first deliverable to
  the user.

### 2. Decide the best home for each lemma

- For each gap, ask: where in the repo does this lemma belong? Match the routing in
  [`../wiki/repo-map.md`](../wiki/repo-map.md):
  - reusable math / coding theory / polynomials → `ArkLib/Data/`
  - general-purpose extensions meant for upstreaming → `ArkLib/ToMathlib/`
  - IOR core / security theory → `ArkLib/OracleReduction/`
  - protocol-specific → `ArkLib/ProofSystem/`
  - commitment-specific → `ArkLib/CommitmentScheme/`
- Prefer keeping a lemma next to the definitions it is about, not next to the theorem that happens
  to need it. A reusable algebraic fact about an existing structure usually belongs in `Data/` or
  `ToMathlib/`, not buried in a protocol file.
- Decide whether a **new file** is warranted. Create one only when several related lemmas share a
  topic that does not fit an existing file, or when adding them would push a file past the long-file
  cap or muddy its module docstring. Otherwise extend an existing file.
- If you add, rename, or move files under `ArkLib/`, `git add` the new paths so validation sees
  them, and give each new file the Apache header + module docstring per
  [`../../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

### 3. State each gap as a sorried-out lemma

- If a gap is only an inline `sorry` inside a larger proof, decide whether it should be extracted
  into a named lemma. Extract when the fact is reusable, independently meaningful, or large enough
  to clutter the host proof. Keep it inline when it is a trivial step tied to local context.
- For every gap you extract or formalize, write the statement first with `:= by sorry` (or
  `:= sorry`), with a proper name (`snake_case` theorem name), docstring, and the right variable
  conventions. Make the statement self-contained and as general as is natural — but do not
  over-generalize past what the call site needs.
- Build after stating, so the `sorry`-ed lemmas typecheck and the call sites still compile against
  the new statements before you attempt any proof.

### 4. Prove everything rated below 6

- Prove every gap rated 1–5. Leave 6+ as documented `sorry`s (see step 6).
- Reuse first: search Mathlib and ArkLib for an existing lemma before writing anything. Use
  `exact?`, `apply?`, `rw?`, `simp?`, and `loogle`/`Loogle`-style name searches. A one-line
  `exact foo` beats a ten-line bespoke proof.
- Keep proofs composable:
  - Prefer general lemmas that several call sites can reuse over narrowly tailored ones.
  - Avoid introducing new `def`s. If you must, prefer reusing an existing definition or a plain
    `let`/term over a new top-level definition. Every new definition is new API to maintain.
  - Factor a shared sub-fact into its own small lemma rather than copy-pasting a proof block.
- Build and re-check after each proof (`lake env lean File.lean`). Do not batch many unverified
  proofs.

### 5. Clean up the proofs and statements

- Re-read every proof and statement you touched (and adjacent ones if they got entangled):
  - Remove definitions, hypotheses, or intermediate `have`s that turned out unnecessary.
  - Collapse redundant steps; replace long manual chains with a single `simp`/`omega`/`ring` when
    one suffices.
  - Check that statements are not more complex than needed — drop unused binders, prefer `≤`/`<`
    over `≥`/`>`, follow the naming and symbol conventions in
    [`../../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Run [`fix-lean-warnings.md`](fix-lean-warnings.md) over the changed files so no new lint or style
  warnings ship.
- Confirm `./scripts/validate.sh` passes (add `--lint`/`--docs` as appropriate).

### 6. Summarize for the user and suggest skill improvements

- Report a concise summary:
  - the rating table from step 1,
  - for each gap: its chosen home, whether it became a named lemma or stayed inline, and its status
    (proved / deferred),
  - for deferred gaps (rated 6+): why, and what the blocker is (missing API, deep math, design
    decision) so the user can plan the follow-up,
  - any cleanups made in step 5.
- Follow the Maintenance Rule in [`README.md`](README.md): tell the user how this skill could be
  improved — a recurring rating heuristic, a placement rule worth codifying, a proof tactic that
  kept paying off — and update this file if it will help the next agent.

## Persistence Rule

Only consider the task complete when:

1. Every gap in scope has a rating and a placement decision.
2. Every gap rated below 6 is proved, or you have explained precisely why a sub-6 rating turned out
   wrong (and re-rated it).
3. Every remaining `sorry` is a deliberately deferred, documented gap rated 6+.
4. `./scripts/validate.sh` passes and `ReadLints` is clean for every changed file.
5. You have delivered the summary and any suggested skill improvements.

## Known Pitfalls

- A gap that looks like a 2 is often a 5 once you see the real goal state — rate from the goal, not
  the prose.
- Do not invent new definitions to make a proof go through; that trades a proof gap for permanent
  API debt. Reach for existing lemmas first.
- Extracting every inline `sorry` into a top-level lemma can bloat a file. Extract for reuse or
  size, not reflexively.
- Re-rate honestly: if a "sub-6" proof balloons, stop, mark it deferred with the new rating, and
  say so in the summary rather than forcing a brittle proof.
