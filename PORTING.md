# Core Rebuild: Porting Progress

Tracking the replacement of ArkLib's core IOR layer with one built on
`Interaction.Spec` (W-type game trees) + `RoleDecoration`.
Branch: `quang/core-rebuild`, based on `quang/bump-comppoly`.

Reference branch: `quang/iop-refactor` (old Refactor/ approach, archived).

## Current snapshot

As of commit `5be189b3`, the interaction-native oracle layer is the active
design:

- `Interaction/Oracle` is split into `Core.lean`, `Composition.lean`,
  `Continuation.lean`, and `StateChain.lean`, with `Oracle.lean` as the public
  entrypoint.
- `InteractiveOracleVerifier` no longer bakes in `OptionT`; plain verifier
  output is separate from output-oracle access semantics.
- `OracleReduction` and `OracleReduction.Continuation` now use
  transcript-dependent output oracle families, on par with `OracleVerifier`.
- `OracleReduction.run` / `execute` are derived defs rather than stored fields.
- Reification is now optional and lives in `Interaction/OracleReification.lean`.
- Oracle-local files are currently `sorry`-free:
  `Interaction/Oracle/`, `Interaction/OracleReification.lean`,
  `Interaction/OracleSecurity.lean`.
- Verified builds currently include:
  - `lake build ArkLib.Interaction.Oracle`
  - `lake build ArkLib.Interaction.OracleReification`
  - `lake build ArkLib.Interaction.OracleSecurity`
  - `lake build ArkLib.ProofSystem.Sumcheck.Interaction.Oracle`

## Architecture

```
Interaction/             ← generic, standalone (future VCVio)
  Basic.lean               Spec.{u} (W-type), Transcript, Strategy, Decoration,
                           Decoration.map, Decoration.Refine, BundledMonad,
                           MonadDecoration,                            append/replicate/Chain (continuation-style),

                           runWithRoles (returns both outputs),
                           SenderDecoration (= Refine over RoleDecoration),
                           per-node monad variants, role-aware

                           `Directed` sender/receiver/hidden interaction,
                           definitional examples including quotient observation
  Reduction.lean           Prover (monadic setup, plain WitnessIn),
                           Verifier (= Counterpart with transcript-indexed leaf
                           output), transcript-indexed StatementOut/WitnessOut,

                           rbrKnowledgeSoundness (currently via random
                           challenger + transcript predicates)
  Oracle/
    Core.lean              OracleDecoration, QueryHandle, toOracleSpec,
                           answerQuery, oracle routing lemmas,
                           OracleCounterpart, InteractiveOracleVerifier,

  (TODO) FRI, Binius, ...
```

No `ProtocolSpec` or `Direction` wrapper — `Spec` + `RoleDecoration` replaces
`ProtocolSpec n` entirely. No separate `TwoParty` or `Multiparty` inductive —
roles are a decoration on `Spec`.

## Completed

- [x] **Phase 1: Interaction foundation** — `Spec`, `Transcript`, `Strategy`,
  `Decoration`, `append`, `comp` in `Basic.lean`, universe-polymorphic
- [x] **Phase 2: Two-party and reduction** — `Role`, `RoleDecoration`,
  `Strategy.withRoles`, `Counterpart`, `runWithRoles` in `TwoParty.lean`;
  `Prover`, `Verifier`, `Reduction`, `execute` in `Reduction.lean`
- [x] **Phase 2b: Kill TwoParty / Multiparty inductives** — removed both
  separate inductives; roles are now a `Decoration (fun _ => Role)` on `Spec`;
  N-party is `Spec` + `PartyDecoration` + `Decoration.map`; all `rfl` examples
  pass through the projection
- [x] **Phase 2c: Monad decoration generalization** — `BundledMonad` standalone
  at root; `Counterpart.withMonads` fully monadic (uses node monad at all roles);
  `runWithRolesAndMonads` takes two separate monad decorations (strategy vs
  counterpart); `Decoration.map` added for natural transformations between
  decorations
- [x] **Phase 2d: Universe polymorphism** — `Spec.{u}`, `BundledMonad.{u,v}`,
  `Decoration.{u,v}`, `Strategy.{u}`, all combinators universe-polymorphic;
  `TwoParty.lean` / `Reduction.lean` work at `u = 0`
- [x] **Phase 2e: N-ary composition** — `replicate`, `Chain` (continuation-
  style), `stateChain` (state-indexed), `iterate`, `stateChainComp`,
  `Transcript.stateChainJoin` / `stateChainUnjoin`, and `stateChainFamily`
  for `Spec`, `Decoration`, `Strategy`, `Transcript`; round-trip lemmas
  (`split_append`, `append_split`, `stateChainSplit_stateChainAppend`,
  `stateChainUnjoin_join`, `stateChainJoin_unjoin`); role-aware wrappers for
  `RoleDecoration`, `Counterpart`, `Strategy.withRoles`
- [x] **Phase 2f: Decoration.Refine** — displayed decoration combinator
  (cf. displayed algebras, ornaments). `Refine F spec d` carries `F X l` at
  each node with label `l : L X` from decoration `d`. Composition:
  `Refine.append`, `.replicate`, `.stateChain`, `.map`. `SenderDecoration` in
  `TwoParty.lean` as a specialization to `RoleDecoration`.
- [x] **Phase 3: OracleDecoration** — `OracleDecoration` assigns
  `OracleInterface` instances at sender nodes (data, not typeclass).
  `QueryHandle` indexes oracle queries parameterized by a transcript (path-
  dependent oracle access — fundamental to W-type interactions where move types
  depend on prior moves). `toOracleSpec` and `answerQuery` defined by recursion.
- [x] **Phase 3b: Oracle verifier redesign** —
  `OracleCounterpart` models the round-by-round challenger with growing oracle
  access (`accSpec` starts at `[]ₒ`, grows by `oi.toOC.spec` at sender nodes).
  `InteractiveOracleVerifier` is the unified recursive type with plain leaf
  verifier output (no baked-in `OptionT`). `OracleVerifier` bundles `iov` +
  transcript-dependent `simulate`; reification moved out to the optional
  `OracleReification` layer. `OracleProver` and `OracleReduction` are defined.

- [x] **Phase 3c: Oracle reduction cutover** —
  `OracleReduction` and `OracleReduction.Continuation` now use
  transcript-dependent output oracle families, matching the dependency level of
  `OracleVerifier`. `run` / `execute` are derived defs. Binary composition,
  continuation retargeting, simulator composition, and state-chain verifier
  composition all build on the new interface.

- [x] **Phase 3d: Oracle module cleanup** —
  the old monolithic `Interaction/Oracle.lean` has been split into focused
  submodules (`Core`, `Composition`, `Continuation`, `StateChain`) and the
  public entrypoint is now a lightweight re-export file. Oracle-local files are
  currently `sorry`-free.

- [x] **Phase 4: Security definitions** — `randomChallenger` (generic sampler
  to `Counterpart ProbComp`), `Reduction.completeness` / `perfectCompleteness`,
  `soundness`, `knowledgeSoundness`, `ClaimTree` / `KnowledgeClaimTree`
  (inductive on `Spec` + `RoleDecoration`), `good`/`Terminal`/`follow`/
  `terminalGood`/`maxPathError`/`IsSound`, `bound_terminalProb`
  (`sorry` proof), `rbrSoundness` / `rbrKnowledgeSoundness`, and the
  current bridge theorems (`sorry` where noted).
- [x] **Phase 4b: Counterpart output + simplified Reduction/Security** —
  `Counterpart` takes explicit `Output : Transcript spec → Type u` parameter
  (`Output ⟨⟩` at `.done`; old no-output = `fun _ => PUnit`).
  `runWithRoles` returns both prover and counterpart outputs.
  `Counterpart.iterate`/`stateChainComp` thread state `β` (mirrors strategy pattern).
  `OracleCounterpart` takes `Output : OracleSpec → Type` at `.done`;
  `InteractiveOracleVerifier` is now an abbrev to `OracleCounterpart`.
  Plain `Reduction` uses monadic prover setup, plain `WitnessIn`, and
  transcript-indexed `StatementOut` / `WitnessOut` as parallel families
  (no `WitnessOut` dependency on `StatementOut`).
  `Verifier` is an `abbrev` for `Counterpart` with caller-chosen leaf output;
  acceptance semantics live in `StatementOut` / `Accepts`.
  Security uses generic `[HasEvalSPMF m]` instead of `ProbComp`.
- [x] **Phase 4c: Role-aware sequential composition** —
  `Strategy.compWithRoles`, `Counterpart.append`, `Reduction.comp`, and the
  chain builders `Reduction.stateChainComp` / `Reduction.stateChainCompUniform`
  are implemented on top of `Spec.append` / `Spec.stateChain`.
  `Reduction.ofChain` provides stateless reduction composition over `Spec.Chain`.
- [x] **Phase 4d: Security composition + extractor cleanup** —
  `Reduction.comp` now factors through transcript-indexed
  `Reduction.Continuation`, with `reduction1` / `reduction2` naming throughout.
  `Reduction.completeness_comp`, `Reduction.perfectCompleteness_comp`, and
  `Reduction.soundness_comp` are proved against that interface.
  Security relations now take statement output before witness output, and
  `knowledgeSoundness` uses a dedicated `Extractor.Straightline` instead of an
  ad-hoc function type. `knowledgeSoundness_implies_soundness` is available
  when accepted terminal statements admit a canonical transcript-indexed
  `WitnessOut`.

## Oracle.Spec layer (new, cast-free)

The `Oracle.Spec` inductive provides a structural alternative to
`OracleDecoration` on `Interaction.Spec`. It distinguishes `.public` nodes
(value visible to both parties) from `.oracle` nodes (value accessed only
through queries), yielding cast-free `PublicTranscript` indexing.

### Key design decisions

- `Oracle.Verifier.toFun` starts with `accSpec = []ₒ` (hardcoded). Composition
  uses `Counterpart.liftAcc` to bridge the empty accumulated spec to the
  dynamically growing one.
- Security definitions use `OutputRealizes` to bridge behavioral simulation and
  concrete oracle data. Completeness checks `OutputRealizes` as a conjunct.
  Knowledge soundness requires the adversarial prover to output concrete
  `oStmtOut`; the extractor sees it.
- `knowledgeSoundness_implies_soundness` requires `hLangOut` to include
  `OutputRealizes` (acceptance implies realizable output oracle behavior).

## In progress

- [ ] **Composition security for Oracle.Spec** — `Reduction.completeness_comp`
  statement for the new `Oracle.Spec` layer. The old `Interaction/Security.lean`
  has the analog; the new version needs `PublicTranscript` indexing and
  `OutputRealizes` handling.
- [ ] **BCS Oracle.Verifier construction** — combine `PublicQueryVerifier`
  Phase 1 (challenger) and Phase 2 (query/decide) into a proper
  `Oracle.Verifier` on `bcsSpec`. Architecture question: Phase 2 queries
  committed oracles which are `.public` in `bcsSpec`, so they must be accessed
  via output oracle simulation or an appended Phase 2 protocol.
- [ ] **Phase 2 opening protocol** — define `openingSpec`, `openingRoles`,
  Phase 2 prover/verifier for BCS. The old `BCS/Verifier.lean` has stubs
  (all sorry). Depends on `CommitmentScheme.Basic.Opening`.

## Immediate deferred todos

- [x] Prove `knowledgeSoundness_implies_soundness` in `Oracle/Security.lean`.
  Uses `Spec.runWithOracleCounterpart_mapOutputWithRoles` (proved in
  `Execution.lean`) plus `probEvent_mono` / `probEvent_map`.
- [ ] State `Reduction.completeness_comp` for `Oracle.Spec` composition
  (very verbose due to oracle statement handling).
- [ ] Port `Sumcheck/Interaction/Oracle.lean` to native `Oracle.Spec`
  (establishes the migration pattern for other protocols).
- [ ] Revisit generic verifier monads for relations (`MonadQuery`-style),
  deferred during current cutover.

## Planned
- [ ] **Phase 5: Sumcheck migration** — interaction-native sumcheck started:
  `CompPoly` types (`CDegreeLE`, `CMvDegreeLE`), single-round spec/prover/verifier,
  `n`-round `stateChain` composition, oracle layer stub. Remaining: fill `sorry`
  obligations, connect to old `Sumcheck.Spec` proofs, oracle verifier body
- [ ] **Phase 6: Protocol migration** — FRI, Binius, Whir, Stir, Components,
  CommitmentScheme
- [ ] **Fiat-Shamir** — abstract FS transform on Spec + RoleDecoration
- [ ] **DuplexSponge FS** — concrete instantiation (deferred)
- [ ] **BCS transformation** — IOR + commitment → IR (in progress via
  `Oracle/BCS.lean`)

## Open questions / issues

- **OracleInterface integration** (RESOLVED): Oracle access is modeled via
  `OracleDecoration` — a per-sender-node attachment of `OracleInterface`
  instances as data (not typeclass). The oracle spec for querying messages is
  path-dependent (parameterized by the transcript), reflecting the W-type
  structure where move types depend on prior moves. This differs fundamentally
  from the old flat `ProtocolSpec n` approach.

- **Execution of OracleReduction** (PARTIALLY RESOLVED): `OracleReduction.run`
  and `OracleReduction.execute` are reintroduced and build on
  `runWithOracleCounterpart`. The remaining execution-side gap is composition:
  the oracle analog of `Reduction.execute_comp` is still deferred.

- **Growing oracle access**: Both `OracleCounterpart` and
  `InteractiveOracleVerifier` use an `accSpec` parameter that grows at each
  sender node. This faithfully models verifier gaining oracle access round by
  round, supporting non-public-coin protocols. The accumulation is:
  `accSpec₀ = []ₒ`, then `accSpecᵢ₊₁ = accSpecᵢ + oiᵢ.toOC.spec`.
  The `OracleVerifier.iov` field starts with `accSpec = []ₒ`.

- **`simulate` is transcript-dependent; `reify` is optional**: Unlike the flat
  `ProtocolSpec n` model where message types are static, in the W-type model
  the oracle spec depends on the transcript (path through the tree).
  `simulate` is therefore transcript-dependent. Concrete reification is no
  longer part of the core oracle API; it lives in `OracleReification.lean`.

- **Witness typing** (RESOLVED): `WitnessIn` is now a plain type, not
  dependent on the input statement. `WitnessOut` remains parallel to
  `StatementOut` (both indexed by `(s, tr)`), so prover input/output are plain
  products and statement/witness compatibility is expressed in security
  relations rather than in the types.

- **Sequential security composition** (RESOLVED): `Reduction.comp` now consumes
  the second stage as a transcript-indexed `Reduction.Continuation`, so the
  completeness / perfect-completeness / soundness composition theorems can
  quantify directly over first-phase transcripts without encoding the second
  reduction awkwardly inside the theorem statement.

- **Knowledge soundness implies soundness** (RESOLVED): the new `Oracle.Spec`
  version in `Oracle/Security.lean` takes explicit `acceptOStmt` and
  `acceptWitness` parameters (matching the legacy `acceptWitness` pattern) and
  proves soundness from knowledge soundness via `probEvent_mono` and
  `Spec.runWithOracleCounterpart_mapOutputWithRoles`.

- **Verifier-indexed RBR semantics**: `ClaimTree` / `rbrSoundness` currently
  talk about transcript predicates and `randomChallenger`, not the full
  statement-indexed `Verifier` object. This is the main remaining design gap in
  `Security.lean`.

- **Generic verifier monads** (DEFERRED): a later cleanup may let verifier code
  be written in any query-capable monad that lowers coherently to `OracleComp`,
  but the semantic core is intentionally still phrased in `OracleComp` during
  the current cutover.

- **Where Interaction goes long-term**: planned to move to VCVio once stable.
  Keep it import-free from ArkLib (except `Oracle.lean` which bridges VCVio).

Our framework independently converges with several lines of work:
