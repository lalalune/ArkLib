# Papers needed to finish the ArkLib proof-debt grind

For the user: please obtain PDFs for the entries below (DOI / IACR ePrint / arXiv id given).
Triage agents append precise per-residual needs at the bottom as they find them.

## How to deliver
Drop PDFs in `~/papers/arklib/` (any filenames). Items already on disk: unknown — agents will
check `blueprint/src` citations first and strike through rows that turn out to be unneeded.
