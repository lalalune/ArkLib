      <Intuition>Because the claims here touch a long-open problem, we let a proof checker, not the authors, certify what is true. Each statement is one of three kinds, always labelled: proven (a Lean kernel theorem, with its axioms listed), computational (an exact finite calculation anyone can rerun), or open (a conjecture we do not resolve). Nothing in between.</Intuition>
      <p>
        We are deliberate about the epistemic status of every statement, using
        three disjoint labels throughout. The value of a formal-verification
        effort is precisely that the boundary between them is sharp and
        third-partyly checkable.

        Refutation as a deliverable

      <p>
        A countermodel that kills a candidate route is recorded in{" "}
        <code className="inline">DISPROOF_LOG.md</code> and, where it sharpens a
        constraint, formalized as a refutation theorem (the impossibility
        results of Section&nbsp;6). This discipline is what kept the effort from
        drifting into wishful closure. We record one instance in
        Section&nbsp;6: an in-tree energy bound used at one point as if valid at
        prize moment depth was shown by an exact probe to be false, the claim
        retracted, and the corrected bound installed. We present such
        self-corrections in the open, because the kernel honesty contract exists
        to catch exactly this kind of error.
