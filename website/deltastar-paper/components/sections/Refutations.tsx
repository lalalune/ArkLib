        This is the battlefield after the battle. Twenty-eight ideas walked
        into the kernel and did not walk out, and every corpse is labeled with
        a theorem explaining exactly how it died. In most fields failed ideas
        vanish into folklore; here they are load-bearing.
      </Lede>
      <p>
        Twenty-eight attack hypotheses were disposed of during the campaign.
        Under the honesty contract each disposal is a theorem: the dead idea is
        reduced to a sorry-free constraint lemma and recorded in the standing
        disproof log (
        <a href={`${REPO}/DISPROOF_LOG.md`}>
          <code>DISPROOF_LOG.md</code>

        ), so the fleet cannot re-propose it and the boundary of the possible is
        itself machine-checked. We present a selection not as failures but as
        the negative half of the map: each one closes a road that a reasonable
        mathematician, or a reasonable language model, would otherwise walk
        down.

          A doubled-column countermodel separates MDS from general linear codes
          at an MCA quantity, the first such separation, so no staircase law
          for general codes can be parameterized by distance alone.

      <SubSection num="4.2" title="The extremality-surface lineage">
        <p>
          The census programme&rsquo;s conjectured extremal surface was killed
          and rebuilt three times, each kill a formal countermodel found by
          probe: census v1 died on empty rungs contradicting the{" "}
          <M>{String.raw`1/q`}</M> floor; v2 died on a take-over stack carrying{" "}
          <M>{String.raw`n`}</M> field-independent bad scalars at an empty
          adjacent rung (<FileLink f="TakeoverCountermodel" />); v3,
          monomial domination, died twice (
          <FileLink f="MonomialDominationKilled" />). The surviving v4 hybrid
          surface is consistent with every theorem and probe in the tree, and
          its conditional pin non-vacuously recovers the{" "}
          <M>{String.raw`\mathbb{F}_5`}</M> exact value. This is what red-teaming
          a conjecture looks like when the red team must publish countermodels
          the kernel accepts.

      <SubSection num="4.3" title="Machine-checked corrections to the literature">
        <p>
          Two of the campaign&rsquo;s most consequential refutations are
          corrections to the paper chain underlying the Johnson lane itself
          (BCIKS20, Appendix A). Finding 13 showed the rebased weight budget is
          unsatisfiable at genuine cells, exposing a hidden anchor assumption in
          the paper&rsquo;s base case. Finding 14 produced an explicit
          countermodel, at a concrete instance over{" "}
          <M>{String.raw`\mathrm{ZMod}\ 5`}</M>, showing the in-tree
          transcription of the paper&rsquo;s recursion diverges from the
          paper&rsquo;s intent at order 1 for non-monic factors (
          <a href="https://github.com/lalalune/ArkLib/blob/main/ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/Finding14Countermodel.lean">
            <code>BCIKS20/Finding14Countermodel</code>

          ). The repaired, cleared recursion (
          <a href="https://github.com/lalalune/ArkLib/blob/main/ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ProximityGap/BCIKS20/ClearedRecursion.lean">
            <code>BCIKS20/ClearedRecursion</code>
          </a>
          ) then closed the complete Claim-A.2 weight bound with no per-cell
          hypotheses. Formalization did not merely transcribe the literature; it
          debugged it.

      <SubSection num="4.4" title="Self-inflicted and honestly recorded">
        <p>
          The log also records the campaign&rsquo;s own errors: a conjectured
          staircase threshold refuted at band 4 by a tripled-column code; an
          overclaim about reducing the pin to a character-sum estimate,
          retracted twice; a characteristic-zero-to-mod-<M>p</M> lifting that
          fails measurably at <M>n=64</M>; a claimed enumeration closure
          withdrawn when its artifacts turned out to be empty files; and a
          window-cocycle identity that was exact but vacuous. Three documented
          no-gos constrain the window analysis itself: degree-forcing dies at
          the ladder reach, the naive GRS recursion degrades{" "}
          <M>{String.raw`(w,k)\to(3w,2w+k)`}</M>, and the M&ouml;bius
          eigendecomposition provably cannot linearize the bad count (14% of
          probed stacks couple the eigencomponents through the shared witness).
          A campaign that cannot admit error cannot be trusted to report
          success; the disproof log is the evidence that this one can.
