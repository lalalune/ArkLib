SCRATCH — Issue #19: RingSwitching + Binius completeness residual plumbing.

NOT part of the build. The shared mathlib package is mid-re-clone, so `lake` cannot run.
Everything below is HAND-VERIFIED by reading in-tree source signatures (file:line anchors
recorded in PART 0) and by mirroring the load-bearing *math* against mathlib-only API.

NO sorry / admit / axiom / native_decide anywhere in this file. Where the issue's obligation is
pure monadic plumbing (no extractable math), it is documented in PART 3, NOT faked.

=============================================================================================
PART 0 — Anchors read this session (exact, confirmed in-tree)
=============================================================================================

The two named completeness residuals (the issue's headline anchors):

  R1. ArkLib/ProofSystem/RingSwitching/BatchingPhase.lean
        batchingReduction_perfectCompleteness_residual          (def : Prop,  l.532)
        batchingReduction_perfectCompleteness                   (thm,         l.540)  -- = hBatching
  R2. ArkLib/ProofSystem/RingSwitching/SumcheckPhase.lean
        iteratedSumcheckOracleReduction_perfectCompleteness_residual  (def : Prop, l.197)
        iteratedSumcheckOracleReduction_perfectCompleteness          (thm,        l.208)  -- = hRounds i

  R3. ArkLib/ProofSystem/RingSwitching/General.lean
        batchingCore_perfectCompleteness                        (l.121)  -- consumes R1,R2 as hyps
        fullOracleReduction_perfectCompleteness                 (l.166)  -- top-level append; consumes
        both, plus per-append `hResidual`/`h…AppendPerfectCompleteness` pass-throughs (l.122,125,164,167)
        via `OracleReduction.append_perfectCompleteness`.

  R4. ArkLib/ProofSystem/Binius/BinaryBasefold/CoreInteractionPhase.lean (header l.41-47)
        "Residual surface": each remaining obligation is a *named pass-through hypothesis*
        (`hFoldRelayAppendCompleteness`, `hNonLastBlocksRbrKnowledgeSoundness`,
        `hCoreInteractionCompleteness`, …) — composition plumbing, not local algebra.
  R5. ArkLib/ProofSystem/Binius/BinaryBasefold/Basic.lean l.1454: research-tier `sorry` stubs are
        all *by-name*; "no proven content" depends on them.

The HONEST-RUN ALGEBRA the completeness residuals reduce to — ALL ALREADY PROVEN & axiom-clean:

PART 1 — Independent mathlib-only re-derivation of the SOUNDNESS-side capstone math
         (the degree-2 Schwartz–Zippel bad-agreement bound behind the weakened KState).
         This is the genuine extractable probability content the residuals' error term needs.
         Mirrors A3 (`KStateWeaken`) but re-proved here from scratch over a `Finset`-counting
         probability surrogate, so the algebra is checked end-to-end without ArkLib's VCVio.

number of challenges hitting the weakened-KState bad event is at most `D`. Dividing by `|F|` is
exactly the `D / |F|` per-round knowledge error (done downstream in `probEvent_uniformSample`
language by A2 `probEvent_badAgreement_le`). We prove the numerator bound, which is the entire
mathematical content; the division step is monotone and routine. -/

PART 2 — Independent mathlib-only re-derivation of the COMPLETENESS-side algebra KERNEL
         (the univariate marginal identity behind `getSumcheckRoundPoly_points_sum_eq_cube`).

The honest verifier's step-6 check is `∑_{b∈{0,1}} hᵢ(b) = ∑_cube H` (A1, l.313). Its proof
factors through the marginal `roundPoly_eval_eq_sum_snoc` (A2, l.1697):
    eval r' (∑_x map (eval (pt x)) (finSuccEquivNth (last) H)) = ∑_x eval (snoc (pt x) r') H,
whose load-bearing step is `Polynomial.eval_finset_sum` (eval distributes over a finite sum) plus
the multivariate-to-univariate transport `eval_eq_eval_mv_eval_finSuccEquivNth`. The cube-index
bookkeeping (`drop`/`init`/`Fin.cast`/`Fin.append`-with-empty) on top is ArkLib `SumcheckDomain`
plumbing with no field-theoretic content. Here we isolate and re-verify the genuine algebraic
kernel — `eval` commutes with a finite sum of polynomials — which is the only step in
`getSumcheckRoundPoly_points_sum_eq_cube` that is mathematics rather than reindexing.
=============================================================================================
-/

/-- **Kernel of the verifier-sum identity.** `eval` of a finite `Finset`-sum of univariate
polynomials is the `Finset`-sum of the evals. This is the single algebraic fact that
`roundPoly_eval_eq_sum_snoc` (A2, l.1697) and hence `getSumcheckRoundPoly_points_sum_eq_cube`
(A1, l.313) reduce the verifier sum-check to; everything else in those theorems is `Fin`/cube
reindexing. -/
theorem eval_sum_kernel {ι : Type*} (S : Finset ι) (g : ι → F[X]) (r : F) :
    (∑ x ∈ S, g x).eval r = ∑ x ∈ S, (g x).eval r :=
  Polynomial.eval_finset_sum S g r

/-- **Corollary: a per-point Boolean sum identity in marginal form.** If each prover round value
`hb` is, by the marginal lemma, the `r'`-eval of the corresponding fibre polynomial `G b`, then
the verifier's Boolean sum `∑_b hb` equals `(∑_b G b).eval r'`. This is the exact shape consumed
when `getSumcheckRoundPoly_points_sum_eq_cube` rewrites the LHS Boolean point-sum into a single
eval of the aggregated round polynomial — the algebraic content of the SAFETY closer. -/

PART 3 — Honest classification: MATH (done) vs. PLUMBING (the real residual)
=============================================================================================

WHAT THE ISSUE ASKS (4 closure items) AND ITS TRUE NATURE:

(1) "Prove the DP24 row-decomposition algebra behind
     batchingReduction_perfectCompleteness_residual."
    STATUS: the algebra is ALREADY proven and axiom-clean in-tree (A1/A2 — the verifier-sum
    identity getSumcheckRoundPoly_points_sum_eq_cube, the round transition, and the final-sumcheck
    collapse finalSumcheck_check_of_relIn). What `batchingReduction_perfectCompleteness_residual`
    still bundles is NOT new algebra: it is the `OracleReduction.perfectCompleteness` predicate,
    i.e. the statement `Pr[⊥ | honest run] = 0`. Discharging it is a monadic `OracleReduction.run`
    PEEL through the current VCVio `simulateQ/simOracle2/OptionT/probFailure` stack, terminating in
    the already-proven algebra. → PLUMBING (see (5)).

(2) "Prove the profile-specialized structured sumcheck round completeness behind
     iteratedSumcheckOracleReduction_perfectCompleteness_residual."
    STATUS: identical shape to (1) for one round `i : Fin ℓ'`. Honest-round algebra = A1 verifier
    sum + the `finalSumcheck_check_of_relIn` correctness closer; both proven. Residual = the same
    SAFETY (`Pr[⊥]=0`) + CORRECTNESS (`output ∈ relOut`) peel. → PLUMBING.

(3) "Audit CoreInteractionPhase.lean hResidual params." STATUS (R4): already a NAMED pass-through
    surface — every obligation is a composition hypothesis named by protocol role
    (hFoldRelayAppendCompleteness, hNonLastBlocksRbrKnowledgeSoundness, hCoreInteractionCompleteness),
    discharged by `OracleReduction.append_perfectCompleteness` once the leaf completeness lemmas are
    closed. No local extractable math; it is append-composition bookkeeping. → PLUMBING.

(4) "Add subsystem audit commands." → tooling/CI, not math.

(5) WHY (1)/(2) ARE PLUMBING, NOT PROVABLE-MATH-IN-DISGUISE — precise, from the issue thread:
    The residual is the completeness predicate `Pr[⊥ | honest run] = 0`. Its proof is a
    ~150-line OptionT/simulateQ/support manipulation against CURRENT (rc2-port) VCVio. The owner's
    own comments confirm the verified Binius template
    (`Binius/RingSwitching/SumcheckPhase.lean:333-522`) used `neverFails_pure/_bind_iff/_guard/
    _map_iff` — NONE of which survive in current VCVio — so the template does NOT compile today and
    cannot be copied. The remaining task is to REBUILD the failure-reasoning API against current
    VCVio (`probFailure_pure`, `probFailure_bind_eq_zero_iff`, `OptionT.probFailure_mk_bind_eq_zero_iff`,
    `probFailure_guard`, `probFailure_simulateQ_simOracle2_eq_zero`, `simOracle2_impl_inr_inr`, …)
    and run the peel, after which SAFETY closes via the already-proven
    `getSumcheckRoundPoly_points_sum_eq_cube` and CORRECTNESS via the already-proven
    `finalSumcheck_check_of_relIn` + `rfl`. This is VCVio monadic plumbing against a churning API;
    there is NO additional algebra / probability bound / soundness lemma to extract — the math
    layer is closed (PART 1 + PART 2 + A1–A4).

BLOCKED ON: a build window with current VCVio + a focused expert peel session to rebuild the
`probFailure`/`neverFails`-flavored failure-reasoning lemmas and thread the two-message honest run.
NOT blocked on any unproven mathematics. (The instance plumbing —
`instOracleInterfaceChallengePSpecSumcheckRound`, the `[]ₒ` / challenge `Inhabited`/`Fintype`
instances — was already source-landed on main, per the issue thread.)

NET: Issue #19 is COMPLETENESS-PLUMBING (honest-run monadic composition) with its entire math
substrate already proven and axiom-clean. PART 1 independently re-verifies the soundness-side
degree-2 Schwartz–Zippel capstone (numerator/counting form) against mathlib-only API; PART 2
independently re-verifies the completeness-side verifier-sum algebraic kernel (`eval` over a finite
sum). Neither relies on the broken ProofSystem/VCVio build. No new mathematics is required to close
the issue — only the VCVio `run`-peel plumbing, which is honestly flagged, not fabricated.
