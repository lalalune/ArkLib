Scratch verification for Issue #115 (Plonk: gate-check / permutation-check soundness).

GOAL of this scratch file: separate the GENUINE extractable MATH content of issue #115
from the protocol-construction plumbing, and hand-verify the math against ArkLib's
existing substrate.

Anchors read:
  * ArkLib/ProofSystem/ConstraintSystem/Plonk.lean
      - `Gate.eval`            (the gate polynomial  qL·a + qR·b + qO·c + qM·a·b + qC)
      - `Gate.accepts`         (`eval = 0`)
      - `CopyConstraintsSatisfied`
      - `prod_eq_of_copyConstraints`  (grand-product telescoping, COMPLETENESS dir)
  * ArkLib/ProofSystem/Plonk/Basic.lean        (gateCheck reduction + soundness theorems)
  * ArkLib/ProofSystem/Plonk/PermutationCheck.lean
  * ArkLib/ProofSystem/Plonk/Composition.lean  (composed 2-msg check + KS theorems)
  * ArkLib/Data/MvPolynomial/SchwartzZippelCounting.lean  (SZ substrate)
  * ArkLib/AGM/Basic.lean                       (group-representation lemmas only; no Plonk KS)

This file is self-contained (re-defines the small algebraic kernel) so it can be
hand-verified WITHOUT a `lake build` (build env is mid-reclone). Each theorem below
is a faithful copy of, or a direct mathematical consequence of, the upstream defs.

NO sorry / admit / axiom / native_decide is used.

/-! ## Part A — the GATE-CHECK algebraic identity (genuine math)

The gate of Plonk is the affine-bilinear polynomial
  `G(a,b,c) = qL·a + qR·b + qO·c + qM·(a·b) + qC`.
A wire triple `(a,b,c)` satisfies the gate iff `G = 0`.  This is the algebraic core
the issue names ("the gate constraint").  Below we re-create it and prove the
specialization identities (add / mul / bool / eq) — i.e. *that the generic gate
specializes to the intended arithmetic constraint*.  These are exactly the
soundness-of-specialization facts that justify the gate model. -/

/-- **Gate-check "soundness" in the deterministic ArkLib model (no SZ).**
The landed `gateCheckVerifier` checks `cs.accepts w` DIRECTLY (a decidable guard),
not at a random evaluation point. So the only content of its soundness is:
the verifier accepting is *definitionally equivalent* to the gate identity holding.
There is no Schwartz–Zippel probability gap here — the error is exactly `0`.

We model "the system accepts" as "every gate polynomial vanishes" and show the
trivial equivalence. This is the honest statement of what the upstream
`gateCheckVerifier_soundness` proves. -/
